IMMUNE AND GENOMIC CORRELATES OF RESPONSE TO ANTI-PD-1 IMMUNOTHERAPY IN GLIOBLASTOMA

ABSTRACT

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been successful across several tumor types; however, their efficacy has been uncommon and unpredictable in glioblastomas (GBM), where <10% of patients show long-term responses. To understand the molecular determinants of immunotherapeutic response in GBM, we longitudinally profiled 66 patients, including 17 long-term responders, during standard therapy and after treatment with PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab or pembrolizumab). Genomic and transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant enrichment of PTEN mutations associated with immunosuppressive expression signatures in non-responders, and an enrichment of MAPK pathway alterations ( PTPN11 , BRAF ) in responders. Responsive tumors were also associated with branched patterns of evolution from the elimination of neoepitopes, as well as differences in T cell clonal diversity and tumor microenvironment profiles. Our study shows that clinical response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in GBM is associated with specific molecular alterations, immune expression signatures, and immune infiltration that reflect the tumorâ€™s clonal evolution during treatment.
