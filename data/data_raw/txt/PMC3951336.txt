RECURRENT SOMATIC ALTERATIONS OFFGFR1ANDNTRK2IN PILOCYTIC ASTROCYTOMA

ABSTRACT

Pilocytic astrocytoma, the most common childhood brain tumor 1 , is typically associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway alterations 2 . Surgically inaccessible midline tumors are therapeutically challenging, showing sustained tendency for progression 3 and often becoming a chronic disease with substantial morbidities 4 .

Here we describe whole-genome sequencing of 96 pilocytic astrocytomas, with matched RNA sequencing (n=73), conducted by the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) PedBrain Tumor Project. We identified recurrent activating mutations in FGFR1 and PTPN11 and novel NTRK2 fusion genes in non-cerebellar tumors. New BRAF activating changes were also observed. MAPK pathway alterations affected 100% of tumors analyzed, with no other significant mutations, indicating pilocytic astrocytoma as predominantly a single-pathway disease.

Notably, we identified the same FGFR1 mutations in a subset of H3F3A -mutated pediatric glioblastoma with additional alterations in NF1 5 . Our findings thus identify new potential therapeutic targets in distinct subsets of pilocytic astrocytoma and childhood glioblastoma.
