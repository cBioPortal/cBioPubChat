FREQUENT SOMATICCDH1LOSS-OF-FUNCTION MUTATIONS IN PLASMACYTOID-VARIANT BLADDER CANCER

ABSTRACT

Plasmacytoid bladder cancer is an aggressive histologic variant with a high risk of disease-specific mortality. Using whole exome and targeted sequencing, we find that truncating somatic alterations in the CDH1 gene occur in 84% of plasmacytoid carcinomas and are specific to this histologic variant. Consistent with the aggressive clinical behavior of plasmacytoid carcinomas, which frequently recur locally, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of CDH1 in bladder cancer cells enhanced cell migration.
