THE GENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF INTRINSIC AND ACQUIRED RESISTANCE TO CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 4/6 INHIBITORS IN PATIENTS WITH HORMONE RECEPTOR POSITIVE METASTATIC BREAST CANCER

ABSTRACT

Mechanisms driving resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors in HR+ breast cancer have not been clearly defined. Whole exome sequencing of 59 tumors with CDK4/6i exposure revealed multiple candidate resistance mechanisms including RB1 loss, activating alterations in AKT1 , RAS , AURKA , CCNE2, ERBB2, and FGFR2, and loss of ER expression. In vitro experiments confirmed that these alterations conferred CDK4/6i resistance. Cancer cells cultured to resistance with CDK4/6i also acquired RB1 , KRAS , AURKA , or CCNE2 alterations, which conferred sensitivity to AURKA, ERK, or CHEK1 inhibition. Three of these activating alterations—in AKT1 , RAS , and AURKA —have not to our knowledge been previously demonstrated as mechanisms of resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer preclinically or in patient samples. Together, these eight mechanisms were present in 66% of resistant tumors profiled and may define therapeutic opportunities in patients.
