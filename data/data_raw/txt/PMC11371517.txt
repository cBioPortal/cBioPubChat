TUMOR-AGNOSTIC GENOMIC AND CLINICAL ANALYSIS OFBRAFFUSIONS IDENTIFY ACTIONABLE TARGETS

ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND:

Even though BRAF fusions are increasingly detected in standard multigene next-generation sequencing panels, few reports have explored their structure and impact on clinical course.

PATIENTS AND METHODS:

We collected data from patients with BRAF fusion-positive cancers identified through a genotyping protocol of 97,024 samples. Fusions were characterized and reviewed for oncogenic potential (in-frame status, non- BRAF partner gene, intact BRAF kinase domain).

RESULTS:

We found 241 BRAF fusion-positive tumors from 212 patients with 82 unique 5â€™ fusion partners spanning 52 histologies. 39 fusion partners were not previously reported, and 61 were identified once. BRAF fusion incidence was enriched in pilocytic astrocytomas, gangliomas, low-grade neuroepithelial tumors, and acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas. 24 patients spanning multiple histologies were treated with MAPK-directed therapies of which 20 were evaluable for RECIST. Best response was partial response ( N =2), stable disease ( N =11), and progressive disease ( N =7). The median time on therapy was 1 month with MEK plus BRAF inhibitors ([ N =11], range 0-18 months) and 8 months for MEK inhibitors ([ N =14], range 1-26 months). 9 patients remained on treatment for longer than 6 months [pilocytic astrocytomas ( N =6), Erdheim-Chester disease ( N =1), extraventricular neurocytoma ( N =1), melanoma ( N =1)]. Fifteen patients had acquired BRAF fusions.

CONCLUSIONS:

BRAF fusions are found across histologies and represent an emerging actionable target. BRAF fusions have a diverse set of fusion partners. Durable responses to MAPK therapies were seen, particularly in pilocytic astrocytomas. Acquired BRAF fusions were identified after targeted therapy underscoring the importance of post-progression biopsies to optimize treatment at relapse in these patients.
