CLINICAL AND BIOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF DRIVER MUTATIONS IN MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES

ABSTRACT

MDS is characterized by mutations in >40 genes, a complex structure of gene-gene interactions and extensive subclonal diversification. The total number of oncogenic mutations and early detection of subclonal mutations are significant prognostic variables in MDS.
