A CLINICALLY APPLICABLE INTEGRATIVE MOLECULAR CLASSIFICATION OF MENINGIOMAS

ABSTRACT

Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumor in adults 1 . Symptomatic patients are treated with surgery and there are no effective medical therapies. While the World Health Organization (WHO) histopathological grade of the tumor and the extent of resection at surgery (Simpson grade) are associated with recurrence of disease, they do not accurately reflect the clinical behavior of all meningiomas 2 . Molecular classifications of meningioma that reliably reflect tumor behaviour and inform on therapies are greatly needed. Here we introduce four novel consensus molecular groups of meningioma by combining DNA somatic copy number aberrations, DNA somatic point mutations, DNA methylation and messenger RNA abundance in a unified analysis. These molecular groups more accurately predicted clinical outcomes in comparison to existing classification schemes. Each molecular group showed distinctive and prototypical biology (immunogenic, NF2 -wildtype, hypermetabolic, and proliferative) that informed on novel therapeutic options. Proteogenomic characterization reinforced the robustness of the newly defined molecular groups and uncovered highly abundant and group-specific protein targets that we validated using immunohistochemistry. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed inter-individual variations in meningioma as well as variations in intrinsic expression programs in neoplastic cells that mirrored the biology of the molecular groups we have identified.
