FIRST-LINE PEMBROLIZUMAB AND TRASTUZUMAB IN HER2-POSITIVE ESOPHAGOGASTRIC CANCER

ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND

Adding trastuzumab to first-line chemotherapy improves overall survival in patients with HER2-positive metastatic gastric cancer. We assessed the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in first-line HER2-positive metastatic esophagogastric (EG) cancer.

METHODS

This was an open-label, non-randomized, single-arm, investigator-initiated single center phase 2 trial in patients aged 18 years or older with HER2-positive mEG cancer. Eligible patients had measurable or evaluable non-measurable disease at baseline, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, 1, or 2, and baseline left ventricular ejection fraction of ≥ 53%. Patients were eligible to receive an initial induction cycle of intravenous (IV) pembrolizumab (200 mg flat dose) and IV trastuzumab 8 mg/kg loading dose. For subsequent cycles, patients received IV oxaliplatin 130 mg/m 2 or cisplatin 80 mg/m 2 on day 1, oral capecitabine 850 mg/m 2 twice a day for 2 weeks followed by 1 week off, or IV 5-FU 800 mg/m 2 /day on day 1 to 5, and IV pembrolizumab 200 mg flat dose and trastuzumab 6 mg/kg, both administered on day 1 of each 3-week cycle. The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS). Pre-treatment tumor and plasma samples were collected for confirmation of HER2 status and exploratory biomarker analysis by targeted and whole exome sequencing. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov , number NCT02954536 (ongoing, closed to enrollment).

FINDINGS

Between Nov 11, 2016, and Jan 23, 2019, 37 patients were enrolled. At the time of data cutoff on Aug 6, 2019, the median follow-up among survivors was 13 months (range 6–31). The primary endpoint was achieved; 26 of 37 (70%, 95% CI 54–83%) patients were progression-free at 6 months. The overall response rate among 35 patients with measurable disease was 91% (32 patients, 95% CI 78–97%), including 6 (17%) complete responses, 26 (74%) partial responses, and 3 (8%) stable disease. The median PFS was 13.0 months (95% CI 8.6–NA), median overall survival (OS) was 27.2 months (95% CI 18.8–NA), and the 12-month OS rate was 80% (95% CI 68–95%). The most common treatment-related adverse event of any grade was neuropathy, which affected 36 (97%) of the 37 patients. Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 21 (67%) patients, and serious adverse events occurred in 2. Two patients discontinued treatment due to treatment-related adverse events, and 4 discontinued pembrolizumab due to immune-related adverse events. ERBB2 amplification or focal gain was detected in 21 of 32 patients (66%) patients who had tumor sequencing and in 18 of 33 patients (54%) whose circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was sequenced. Tissue and ctDNA sequencing were concordant for presence or absence of ERBB2 amplification in 27 of 29 patients (93%). A decline in tumor-matched ctDNA was observed after the first dose of pembrolizumab and trastuzumab in 13 of the 16 patients with tumor-matched pre-treatment ctDNA. Patients with ERBB2 amplification in both tumor and ctDNA had longer PFS; median 16.4 (n = 14, 95% CI 13.0–NA) versus 6.2 months (n = 12, 95% CI 5.9–NA) in those who did not (p = 0.013).

INTERPRETATION

Pembrolizumab can be safely combined with trastuzumab and chemotherapy and has promising activity in HER2-positive mEG cancer irrespective of PD-L1 status. Plasma-based ctDNA should be explored in future randomized studies as a predictive biomarker. A randomized phase 3 clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab versus placebo in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in first-line HER2-positive mEG cancer is currently underway.
