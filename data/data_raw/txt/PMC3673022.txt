EXOME SEQUENCING IDENTIFIES RECURRENT SPOP, FOXA1 AND MED12 MUTATIONS IN PROSTATE CANCER

ABSTRACT

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide and causes over 250,000 deaths each year 1 . Overtreatment of indolent disease also results in significant morbidity 2 . Common genetic alterations in prostate cancer include losses of NKX3.1 (8p21) 3 , 4 and PTEN (10q23) 5 , 6 , gains of the androgen receptor gene ( AR ) 7 , 8 and fusion of ETS-family transcription factor genes with androgen-responsive promoters 9 – 11 . Recurrent somatic base-pair substitutions are believed to be less contributory in prostate tumorigenesis 12 , 13 but have not been systematically analyzed in large cohorts. Here we sequenced the exomes of 112 prostate tumor/normal pairs. Novel recurrent mutations were identified in multiple genes, including MED12 and FOXA1 . SPOP was the most frequently mutated gene, with mutations involving the SPOP substrate binding cleft in 6–15% of tumors across multiple independent cohorts. SPOP- mutant prostate cancers lacked ETS rearrangements and exhibited a distinct pattern of genomic alterations. Thus, SPOP mutations may define a new molecular subtype of prostate cancer.
