MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY-HIGH ENDOMETRIAL CANCERS WITHMLH1PROMOTER HYPERMETHYLATION HAVE DISTINCT MOLECULAR AND CLINICAL PROFILES

ABSTRACT

PURPOSE:

Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) endometrial carcinomas (ECs) are underpinned by distinct mechanisms of DNA mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-D). We sought to characterize the clinical and genetic features of MSI-H ECs harboring germline or somatic mutations in MMR genes or MLH1 promoter hypermethylation ( MLH1 ph).

DESIGN:

Of >1,100 EC patients that underwent clinical tumor-normal sequencing, 184 had MSI-H ECs due to somatic MMR mutations or MLH1 ph, or harbored pathogenic germline MMR mutations. Clinicopathologic features, mutational landscape, and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) scores were compared among MMR-D groups using non-parametric tests. Log-rank tests were used for categorical associations; Kaplan-Meier method and Wald-test based on Cox proportional-hazards models were employed for continuous variables and survival analyses.

RESULTS:

Compared to patients with germline (n=25) and somatic (n=39) mutations, patients with MLH1 ph ECs (n=120) were older (p<0.001), more obese (p=0.001) and had more advanced disease at diagnosis (p=0.025). MLH1 ph ECs were enriched for JAK1 somatic mutations as opposed to germline MMR-D ECs which showed enrichment for pathogenic ERBB2 mutations. MLH1 ph ECs exhibited lower tumor mutational burden and TIL scores compared to ECs harboring germline or somatic MMR mutations (p<0.01). MLH1 ph EC patients had shorter progression-free survival (PFS) on univariate analysis, but in multivariable models stage at diagnosis remained the only predictor of survival. For stage I/II EC, two-year PFS was inferior for patients with MLH1 ph ECs compared to germline and somatic MMR groups (70% vs. 100%, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS:

MLH1 ph ECs likely constitute a distinct clinicopathologic entity compared to germline and somatic MMR-D ECs with potential treatment implications.
