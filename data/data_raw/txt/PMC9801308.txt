GENOMIC AND TRANSCRIPTOMIC DETERMINANTS OF RESPONSE TO NEOADJUVANT
THERAPY IN RECTAL CANCER

ABSTRACT

The incidence of rectal cancer is increasing among patients younger than
50 years. Locally advanced rectal cancer is still treated with neoadjuvant
radiation, chemotherapy and surgery, but recent evidence suggests that patients
with a complete response can avoid surgery permanently. To define correlates of
response to neoadjuvant therapy, we analyzed genomic and transcriptomic profiles
of 738 untreated rectal cancers. APC mutations were less
frequent in the lower than the middle and upper rectum, which could explain the
more aggressive behavior of distal tumors. No somatic alterations showed
significant associations with response to neoadjuvant therapy in a
treatment-agnostic manner, but KRAS mutations were associated
with faster relapse in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed
by consolidative chemotherapy. Overexpression of IGF2 and L1CAM was associated with decreased response to neoadjuvant
therapy. RNA-Seq estimates of immune infiltration identified a subset of
microsatellite stable immune hot tumors with increased response and prolonged
disease-free survival.
