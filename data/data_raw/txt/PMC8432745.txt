GENOMIC AND EVOLUTIONARY CLASSIFICATION OF LUNG CANCER IN NEVER SMOKERS

ABSTRACT

Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) is a common cause of cancer mortality, but its genomic landscape is poorly characterized. Here, high-coverage whole genome sequencing of 232 LCINS showed three subtypes defined by copy number aberrations. The dominant subtype ( ‘piano’ ), rare in lung cancer in smokers, features somatic UBA1 mutations, germline AR variants, and stem cell-like properties, including low mutational burden, high intra-tumor heterogeneity, long telomeres, frequent KRAS mutations, and slow growth, as suggested by the occurrence of cancer drivers’ progenitor cells many years prior to tumor diagnosis. The other subtypes are characterized by specific amplifications and EGFR mutations (‘ mezzo-forte ’), and whole genome doubling ( ‘forte’ ). No strong tobacco smoking signatures were detected, even in cases with exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke. Genes within the RTK-RAS pathway had distinct impacts on survival, and five genomic alterations independently doubled mortality. These findings create avenues for personalized treatment in LCINS.
