CHROMATIN PROFILES CLASSIFY CASTRATION-RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCERS SUGGESTING THERAPEUTIC TARGETS

ABSTRACT

In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the loss of androgen receptor (AR)-dependence leads to clinically aggressive tumors with few therapeutic options. We used ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and DNA sequencing to investigate 22 organoids, 6 patient-derived xenografts, and 12 cell lines. We identified the well-characterized AR-dependent and neuroendocrine subtypes and two AR-negative/low groups. These include a Wnt-dependent subtype, and a stem cell-like (SCL) subtype driven by the Activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors. Transcriptomic signatures were used to classify 366 patients, showing SCL subtype as the second most common group of CRPC after AR-dependent. Our data suggest AP-1 interacts with the YAP/TAZ and TEAD proteins to maintain subtype-specific chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic landscapes in this group. Together, this molecular classification reveals drug targets and can potentially guide therapeutic decisions.
