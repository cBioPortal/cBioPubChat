NEXT-GENERATION CHARACTERIZATION OF THE CANCER CELL LINE ENCYCLOPEDIA

ABSTRACT

Large panels of comprehensively characterized human cancer models, including the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), have provided a rigorous backbone upon which to study genetic variants, candidate targets, small molecule and biological therapeutics and to identify new marker-driven cancer dependencies. To improve our understanding of the molecular features that contribute to cancer phenotypes including drug responses, here we have expanded the characterizations of cancer cell lines to include genetic, RNA splicing, DNA methylation, histone H3 modification, microRNA expression and reverse-phase protein array data for 1,072 cell lines from various lineages and ethnicities. Integrating these data with functional characterizations such as drug-sensitivity data, short hairpin RNA knockdown and CRISPRâ€“Cas9 knockout data reveals potential targets for cancer drugs and associated biomarkers. Together, this dataset and an accompanying public data portal provide a resource to accelerate cancer research using model cancer cell lines.
