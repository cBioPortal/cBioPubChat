THE GENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF ENDOCRINE-RESISTANT ADVANCED BREAST
CANCERS

ABSTRACT

We integrated the genomic sequencing of 1,918 breast cancers, including
1,501 hormone receptor-positive tumors, with detailed clinical information and
treatment outcomes. In 692 tumors previously exposed to hormonal therapy, we
identified an increased number of alterations in genes involved in the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and in the estrogen receptor
transcriptional machinery. Activating ERBB2 mutations and NF1 loss-of-function mutations were more than twice as
common in endocrine resistant tumors. Alterations in other MAPK pathway genes
( EGFR , KRAS, among others) and estrogen
receptor transcriptional regulators ( MYC , CTCF , FOXA1 , and TBX3 ) were
also enriched. Altogether, these alterations were present in 22% of tumors,
mutually exclusive with ESR1 mutations, and associated with a
shorter duration of response to subsequent hormonal therapies
