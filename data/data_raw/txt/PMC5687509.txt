COMPREHENSIVE MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF MUSCLE INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER

ABSTRACT

We report a comprehensive analysis of 412 muscle-invasive bladder cancers characterized by multiple TCGA analytical platforms. Fifty-eight genes were significantly mutated, and the overall mutational load was associated with APOBEC-signature mutagenesis. Clustering by mutation signature identified a high-mutation subset with 75% 5-year survival. mRNA expression clustering refined prior clustering analyses and identified a poor-survival ‘neuronal’ subtype in which the majority of tumors lacked small cell or neuroendocrine histology. Clustering by mRNA, lncRNA, and miRNA expression converged to identify subsets with differential epithelial-mesenchymal transition status, carcinoma-in-situ scores, histologic features, and survival. Our analyses identified 5 expression subtypes that may stratify response to different treatments.
