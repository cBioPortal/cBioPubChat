LANDSCAPE OF SOMATIC MUTATIONS AND CLONAL EVOLUTION IN MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA

ABSTRACT

This is a comprehensive whole-genome/whole-exome analysis of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). We sequenced 29 MCL cases and validated the findings by target sequencing of 172 additional tumors. We identified recurrent mutations in genes regulating chromatin modification and genes such as NOTCH2 that have a major impact on clinical outcome. Additionally, we demonstrated the subclonal heterogeneity of the tumors already at diagnosis and the modulation of the mutational architecture in the progression of the disease. The identification of new molecular mechanisms may open perspectives for the management of MCL patients.
