INTEGRATED PROTEOGENOMIC CHARACTERIZATION ACROSS MAJOR HISTOLOGICAL TYPES OF PEDIATRIC BRAIN CANCER

ABSTRACT

We report a comprehensive proteogenomic analysis, including whole genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling, of 218 tumors across 7 histologic types of childhood brain cancer: low grade glioma (n=93), ependymoma (32), high grade glioma (25), medulloblastoma (22), ganglioglioma (18), craniopharyngioma (16) and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (12). Proteomic data identifies common biological themes that span histologic boundaries, suggesting that treatments used for one histologic type may be applied effectively to other tumors sharing similar proteomic features. Immune landscape characterization reveals diverse tumor microenvironments across and within diagnoses. Proteomic data further reveal functional impacts of somatic mutations and CNVs not evident in transcriptomic data. Kinase-substrate association and co-expression network analysis identifies important biological mechanisms of tumorigenesis. This is the first large-scale proteogenomic analysis across traditional histologic boundaries to uncover foundational pediatric brain tumor biology and inform rational treatment selection.
