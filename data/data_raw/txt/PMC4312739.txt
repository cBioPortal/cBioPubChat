GENOMIC PREDICTORS OF SURVIVAL IN PATIENTS WITH HIGH-GRADE UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA OF THE BLADDER

ABSTRACT

Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) is genomically heterogeneous, with frequent alterations in genes regulating chromatin state, cell cycle control, and receptor kinase signaling. To identify prognostic genomic markers in high-grade UCB, we utilized capture-based massively-parallel sequencing to analyze 109 tumors.

Mutations were detected in 240 genes, with 23 genes mutated in â‰¥5% of cases. The presence of a recurrent PIK3CA mutation was associated with improved recurrence-free survival (RFS; HR=0.35, p =0.014) and cancer-specific survival (CSS; HR=0.35, p =0.040) in patients treated with radical cystectomy. In multivariable analyses controlling for pT and pN stages, PIK3CA mutation remained associated with RFS (HR=0.39, p =0.032). The most frequent alteration, TP53 mutation (57%), was more common in extravesical (69% vs. 32%, p =0.005) and lymph node-positive (77% vs. 56%, p =0.025) disease. Patients with CDKN2A altered tumors experienced worse RFS (HR=5.76, p <0.001) and CSS (HR=2.94, p =0.029) in multivariable analyses. Mutations in chromatin modifying genes were highly prevalent but not associated with outcomes.

In UCB patients treated with radical cystectomy, PIK3CA mutations are associated with favorable outcomes whereas TP53 and CDKN2A alterations are associated with poor outcomes. Genomic profiling may aid in the identification of UCB patients at highest risk following radical cystectomy.
