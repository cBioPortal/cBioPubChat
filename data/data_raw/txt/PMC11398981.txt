A PHASE II STUDY ASSESSING LONG-TERM RESPONSE TO IBRUTINIB MONOTHERAPY IN RECURRENT OR REFRACTORY CNS LYMPHOMA

ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND:

Ibrutinib is a first-in-class inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). We previously reported the safety and short-term antitumor activity of ibrutinib in 20 patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) primary (PCNSL) or secondary CNS lymphoma (SCNSL).

PATIENTS AND METHODS:

We enrolled 26 additional patients with r/r PCNSL/SCNSL into the dose-expansion cohort of the trial into a combined cohort of 46 patients (31 PCNSLs, 15 SCNSLs). Patients received ibrutinib at 560mg or 840mg daily in the dose-escalation and 840mg daily in the expansion cohort. Median follow up was 49.9 and 62.1 months for patients with PCNSL and SCNSL, respectively. We sequenced DNA from available tumor biopsies and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected before and during ibrutinib therapy.

RESULTS:

Tumor responses were observed in 23/31 (74%) PCNSLs and 9/15 (60%) SCNSLs, including 12 complete responses in PCNSL and 7 in SCNSL. Median progression-free survival (PFS) for PCNSL was 4.5 months (95%CI: 2.8–9.2) with 1y-PFS at 23.7% (95%CI: 12.4%–45.1%). Median duration of response (DOR) in the 23 PCNSL responders was 5.5 months. Median PFS in SCNSL was 5.3 months (95%CI: 1.3–14.5) with a median DOR 8.7 months for the 9 responders. Exploratory biomarker analysis suggests that mutations in TBL1XR1 may be associated with a long-term response to ibrutinib in PCNSL (p=0.0075). Clearance of circulating tumor DNA from CSF was associated with complete and long-term ibrutinib response.

CONCLUSIONS:

Our study confirms single-agent activity of ibrutinib in r/r CNS lymphoma and identifies molecular determinants of response based on long-term follow up.
