HIGH-SENSITIVITY MUTATION ANALYSIS OF CELL-FREE DNA FOR DISEASE MONITORING IN ENDOMETRIAL CANCER

ABSTRACT

PURPOSE:

We sought to determine whether sequencing analysis of circulating cell-free (cf)DNA in prospectively accrued endometrial cancer (EC) patients captures the mutational repertoire of the primary lesion and allows for disease monitoring.

DESIGN:

Peripheral blood was prospectively collected from 44 newly diagnosed EC patients over a 24-month period (i.e., baseline, post-surgery, every six months after). DNA from the primary ECs was subjected to targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 468 cancer-related genes, and cfDNA to a high-depth NGS assay of 129 genes with molecular barcoding. Sequencing data were analyzed using validated bioinformatics methods.

RESULTS:

cfDNA levels correlated with surgical stage in ECs, with higher levels of cfDNA being present in advanced stage disease. Mutations in cfDNA at baseline were detected pre-operatively in 8 of 36 (22%) patients with sequencing data, all of whom were diagnosed with advanced stage disease, high tumor volume and/or aggressive histologic type. Of the 38 somatic mutations identified in the primary tumors also present in the cfDNA assay, 35 (92%) and 38 (100%) were detected at baseline and follow-up, respectively. In six patients with recurrent disease, changes in circulating tumor (ct)DNA fraction/ variant allele fractions in cfDNA during follow-up closely mirrored disease progression and therapy response, with a lead time over clinically-detected recurrence in two cases. The presence of ctDNA at baseline (p<0.001) or post-surgery (p=0.014) was significantly associated with reduced progression-free survival.

CONCLUSIONS:

cfDNA sequencing analysis in EC patients at diagnosis has prognostic value and serial post-surgery cfDNA analysis enables disease and treatment response monitoring.
