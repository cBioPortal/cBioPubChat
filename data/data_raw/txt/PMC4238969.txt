SOMATICERCC2MUTATIONS CORRELATE WITH CISPLATIN SENSITIVITY IN MUSCLE-INVASIVE UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA

ABSTRACT

Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for patients with muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma. Pathologic downstaging to pT0/pTis after neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy is associated with improved survival, although molecular determinants of cisplatin response are incompletely understood. We performed whole exome sequencing on pre-treatment tumor and germline DNA from 50 patients with muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma who received neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy followed by cystectomy (25 pT0/pTis “responders”, 25 pT2+ “non-responders”) to identify somatic mutations that occurred preferentially in responders. ERCC2 , a nucleotide excision repair gene, was the only significantly mutated gene enriched in the cisplatin responders compared with non-responders ( q < 0.01). Expression of representative ERCC2 mutations in an ERCC2-deficient cell line failed to rescue cisplatin and UV sensitivity compared to wild-type ERCC2. Lack of normal ERCC2 function may contribute to cisplatin sensitivity in urothelial cancer and somatic ERCC2 mutation status may inform cisplatin-containing regimen usage in muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma.
