INTEGRATIVE GENOMIC CHARACTERIZATION OF ORAL SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMAIDENTIFIES FREQUENT SOMATIC DRIVERS

ABSTRACT

The survival of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has not changed significantly in several decades, leading clinicians and investigators to search for promising molecular targets. To this end, we performed comprehensive genomic analysis of gene expression, copy number, methylation and point mutations in OSCC. Integrated analysis revealed more somatic events than previously reported, identifying four major driver pathways (mitogenic signaling, Notch, cell cycle, TP53) and two additional key genes ( FAT1 , CASP8 ). The Notch pathway was defective in 66% of patients, and in follow-up studies of mechanism, functional NOTCH1 signaling inhibited proliferation of OSCC cell lines. Frequent mutation of CASP8 defines a new molecular subtype of OSCC with few copy number changes. Although genomic alterations are dominated by loss of tumor suppressor genes, 80% of patients harbored at least one genomic alteration in a targetable gene, suggesting that novel approaches to treatment may be possible for this debilitating disease.
