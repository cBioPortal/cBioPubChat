ONCOGENIC GENOMIC ALTERATIONS, CLINICAL PHENOTYPES, AND OUTCOMES IN METASTATIC CASTRATION-SENSITIVE PROSTATE CANCER

ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND:

The genomic underpinning of clinical phenotypes and outcomes in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer is unclear.

METHODS:

In patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer at a tertiary referral center, clinical-grade targeted tumor sequencing was performed to quantify tumor DNA copy number alterations and alterations in predefined oncogenic signaling pathways. Disease volume was classified as high-volume (≥4 bone metastases or visceral metastases) vs. low-volume.

RESULTS:

Among 424 patients (88% white), 213 (50%) had high-volume disease and 211 (50%) had low-volume disease; 275 (65%) had de-novo metastatic disease and 149 (35%) had metastatic recurrence of non-metastatic disease. Rates of castration resistance (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.40–2.41) and death (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.71; 95% CI, 2.28–6.02) were higher in high-volume disease. Tumors from high-volume disease had more copy number alterations. The NOTCH, cell cycle, and epigenetic modifiers pathways were the highest-ranking pathways enriched in high-volume disease. De-novo metastatic disease differed from metastatic recurrences in the prevalence of CDK12 alterations but had similar prognosis. Rates of castration resistance differed 1.5-fold to 5-fold according to alterations in AR , SPOP (inverse), and TP53 , and the cell cycle, WNT (inverse), and MYC pathways, adjusting for disease volume and other genomic pathways. Overall survival rates differed 2-fold to 4-fold according to AR, SPOP (inverse), WNT (inverse), and cell cycle alterations. PI3K pathway alterations were not associated with prognosis once adjusted for other factors.

CONCLUSION:

This study identified genomic features associated with prognosis in metastatic castration-sensitive disease that may aid in molecular classification and treatment selection.
