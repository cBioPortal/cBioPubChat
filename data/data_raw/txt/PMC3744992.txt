MUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA USING WHOLE-GENOME SEQUENCING

ABSTRACT

Complete genome sequence analysis of 40 DLBCL tumors and 13 cell lines reveals novel somatic point mutations, rearrangements, and fusions. Recurrence of mutations in genes involved in B-cell homing were identified in germinal center B-cell DLBCLs.
