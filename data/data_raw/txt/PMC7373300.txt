PROTEOGENOMIC CHARACTERIZATION REVEALS THERAPEUTIC VULNERABILITIES IN
LUNG ADENOCARCINOMA

ABSTRACT

To explore the biology of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and identify new
therapeutic opportunities, we performed comprehensive proteogenomic
characterization of 110 tumors and 101 matched normal adjacent tissues (NATs)
incorporating genomics, epigenomics, deep-scale proteomics, phosphoproteomics
and acetylproteomics. Multi-omics clustering revealed four subgroups defined by
key driver mutations, country and gender. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic data
illuminated biology downstream of copy number aberrations, somatic mutations and
fusions, and identified therapeutic vulnerabilities associated with driver
events involving KRAS, EGFR and ALK. Immune
subtyping revealed a complex landscape, reinforced the association of STK11 with
immune-cold behavior and underscored a potential immunosuppressive role of
neutrophil degranulation. Smoking-associated LUADs showed correlation with other
environmental exposure signatures and a field effect in NATs. Matched NATs
allowed identification of differentially expressed proteins with potential
diagnostic and therapeutic utility. This proteogenomics dataset represents a
unique public resource for researchers and clinicians seeking to better
understand and treat lung adenocarcinomas.
