WIDESPREAD GENETIC HETEROGENEITY IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA: IMPLICATIONS FOR TARGETED THERAPY

ABSTRACT

SUMMARY

We performed massively parallel sequencing of paired tumor/normal samples from 203 multiple myeloma (MM) patients and identified significantly mutated genes and copy number alterations, and discovered putative tumor suppressor genes by determining homozygous deletions and loss-of-heterozygosity. We observed frequent mutations in KRAS (particularly in previously treated patients), NRAS, BRAF, FAM46C, TP53 and DIS3 (particularly in non-hyperdiploid MM). Mutations were often present in subclonal populations, and multiple mutations within the same pathway (e.g. KRAS, NRAS and BRAF ) were observed in the same patient. In vitro modeling predicts only partial treatment efficacy of targeting subclonal mutations, and even growth promotion of non-mutated subclones in some cases. These results emphasize the importance of heterogeneity analysis for treatment decisions.
