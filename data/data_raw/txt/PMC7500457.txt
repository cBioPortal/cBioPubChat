MICROBIOME ANALYSES OF BLOOD AND TISSUES SUGGEST CANCER DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH

ABSTRACT

Systematic characterization of the cancer microbiome provides a unique opportunity to develop cancer diagnostics that exploit non-human, microbial-derived molecules in a major human disease. Based on recent studies showing significant microbial contributions in select cancer types 1 – 10 , we re-examined treatment-naïve whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing studies (n=18,116 samples) from 33 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas 11 (TCGA) for microbial reads, and found unique microbial signatures in tissue and blood within and between most major cancer types. These TCGA blood signatures remain predictive when applied to stage Ia-IIc cancer patients and cancers lacking any genomic alterations currently measured on two commercial-grade ctDNA platforms, despite very stringent decontamination analyses that discard up to 92.3% of total sequence data. We then independently show the ability to discriminate between and among non-cancer, HIV-, healthy controls (n=69) and multiple cancer types (prostate, lung, and melanoma, 100 total samples) solely using plasma-derived, cell-free microbial nucleic acids. We thus propose a new class of microbial-based oncology diagnostics, warranting further exploration.
