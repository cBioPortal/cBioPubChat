GENOMIC CORRELATES OF DISEASE PROGRESSION AND TREATMENT RESPONSE IN PROSPECTIVELY CHARACTERIZED GLIOMAS

ABSTRACT

PURPOSE:

The genomic landscape of gliomas has been characterized and now contributes to disease classification, yet the relationship between molecular profile and disease progression and treatment response remain poorly understood.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:

We integrated prospective clinical sequencing of 1,004 primary and recurrent tumors from 923 glioma patients with clinical and treatment phenotypes.

RESULTS:

13% of glioma patients harbored a pathogenic germline variant, including a subset associated with heritable genetic syndromes and variants mediating DNA repair dysfunctions (29% of the total) that were associated with somatic biallelic inactivation and mechanism-specific somatic phenotypes. In astrocytomas, genomic alterations in effectors of cell-cycle progression correlated with aggressive disease independent of IDH-mutation status, arose preferentially in enhancing tumors (44% vs. 8%, P <0.001), were associated with rapid disease progression following tumor recurrence (HR=2.6, P =0.02), and likely preceded the acquisition of alkylating therapy-associated somatic hypermutation. Thirty-two percent of patients harbored a potentially therapeutically actionable lesion, of whom 11% received targeted therapies. In BRAF -mutant gliomas, response to agents targeting the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling axis was influenced by the type of mutation, its clonality, and its cellular and genomic context.

CONCLUSIONS:

These data reveal genomic correlates of disease progression and treatment response in diverse types of glioma and highlight the potential utility of incorporating genomic information into the clinical decision-making for patients with glioma.
