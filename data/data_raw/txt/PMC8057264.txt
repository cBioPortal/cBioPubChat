TUMOR-TARGETED NANOPARTICLES IMPROVE THE THERAPEUTIC INDEX OF BCL2 AND MCL1 DUAL INHIBITION

ABSTRACT

Dual inhibition of MCL1 and BCL2 proteins results in a durable remission in DLBCL mouse models. S63845 or venetoclax encapsulated in tumor-targeted nanoparticles improves the therapeutic index of the combination.
