A SPECIFIC MISSENSE MUTATION INGTF2IOCCURS AT HIGH FREQUENCY IN THYMIC EPITHELIAL TUMORS

ABSTRACT

We analyzed 28 thymic epithelial tumors (TETs) using next-generation sequencing and identified a missense mutation (chromosome 7 c.74146970T>A) in GTF2I at high frequency in type A thymomas, a relatively indolent subtype. In a series of 274 TETs, we detected the GTF2I mutation in 82% of type A and 74% of type AB thymomas but rarely in the aggressive subtypes, where recurrent mutations of known cancer genes have been identified. Therefore, GTF2I mutation correlated with better survival. GTF2I β and δ isoforms were expressed in TETs, and both mutant isoforms were able to stimulate cell proliferation in vitro . Thymic carcinomas carried a higher number of mutations than thymomas (average of 43.5 and 18.4, respectively). Notably, we identified recurrent mutations of known cancer genes, including TP53 , CYLD , CDKN2A , BAP1 and PBRM1 , in thymic carcinomas. These findings will complement the diagnostic assessment of these tumors and also facilitate development of a molecular classification and assessment of prognosis and treatment strategies.
