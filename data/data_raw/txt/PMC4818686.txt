WHOLE-GENOME SEQUENCING OF SALIVARY GLAND ADENOID CYSTIC
CARCINOMA

ABSTRACT

Adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) of the salivary glands are challenging
to understand, treat, and cure. To better understand the genetic alterations
underlying the pathogenesis of these tumors, we performed comprehensive genome
analyses of 25 fresh-frozen tumors, including whole genome sequencing,
expression and pathway analyses. In addition to the well-described MYB-NFIB fusion which was found in 11 tumors (44%),
we observed five different rearrangements involving the NFIB transcription factor gene in seven tumors (28%). Taken together, NFIB translocations occurred in 15 of 25 samples
(60%, 95%CI=41â€“77%). In addition, mRNA
expression analysis of 17 tumors revealed overexpression of NFIB in ACC tumors compared with normal tissues
(p=0.002). There was no difference in NFIB mRNA
expression in tumors with NFIB fusions compared to those
without. We also report somatic mutations of genes involved in the axonal
guidance and Rho family signaling pathways. Finally, we confirm previously
described alterations in genes related to chromatin regulation and Notch
signaling. Our findings suggest a separate role for NFIB in ACC
oncogenesis and highlight important signaling pathways for future functional
characterization and potential therapeutic targeting.
