TUMOR MUTATIONAL LOAD PREDICTS SURVIVAL AFTER IMMUNOTHERAPY ACROSS MULTIPLE CANCER TYPES

ABSTRACT

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatments benefit some patients with metastatic cancers, but predictive biomarkers are needed. Findings in select cancer types suggest that tumor mutational burden (TMB) may predict clinical response to ICI.To examine this association more broadly, we analyzed the clinical and genomic data of 1662 advanced cancer patients treated with ICI, and 5371 non-ICI treated patients, whose tumors underwent targeted next-generation sequencing (MSK-IMPACT). Among all patients, higher somatic TMB (highest 20% in each histology) was associated with better OS (HR 0.52; p=1.6 ×10 −6 ). For most cancer histologies, an association between higher TMB and improved survival was observed. The TMB cutpoints associated with improved survival varied markedly between cancer types. These data indicate that TMB is associated with improved survival in patients receiving ICI across a wide variety of cancer types, but that there may not be one universal definition of high TMB.
