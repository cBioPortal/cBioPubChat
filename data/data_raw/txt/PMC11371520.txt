MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY, TUMOR MUTATIONAL BURDEN, AND RESPONSE TO IMMUNE CHECKPOINT BLOCKADE IN PATIENTS WITH PROSTATE CANCER

ABSTRACT

PURPOSE:

Patients with microsatellite instability high/mismatch repair deficient (MSI-H/dMMR) and high tumor mutational burden (TMB-H) prostate cancers are candidates for pembrolizumab. We define the genomic features, clinical course, and response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in patients with MSI-H/dMMR and TMB-H prostate cancers without MSI (TMB-H/MSS).

METHODS:

We sequenced 3,244 tumors from 2,257 prostate cancer patients. MSI-H/dMMR prostate cancer was defined as MSIsensor score ≥10 or MSIsensor score ≥3 and <10 with a deleterious MMR alteration. TMB-H was defined as ≥10 mutations/megabase. PSA 50 and RECIST responses were assigned. Overall survival (OS) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) were compared using log rank test.

RESULTS:

63 (2.8%) men had MSI-H/dMMR and 33 (1.5%) had TMB-H/MSS prostate cancers. Patients with MSI-H/dMMR and TMB-H/MSS tumors more commonly presented with grade group 5 and metastatic disease at diagnosis. MSI-H/dMMR tumors had higher TMB, indel and neoantigen burden compared with TMB-H/MSS. 27 patients with MSI-H/dMMR and 8 patients with TMB-H/MSS tumors received ICB, none of whom harbored POLE mutations. 45% of MSI-H/dMMR patients had a RECIST response and 65% had a PSA 50 response. No TMB-H/MSS patient had a RECIST response and 50% had a PSA 50 response. rPFS tended to be longer in MSI-H/dMMR patients than in TMB-H/MSS patients who received immunotherapy. Pronounced differences in genomics, TMB or MSIsensor score were not detected between MSI-H/dMMR responders and non-responders.

CONCLUSIONS:

MSI-H/dMMR prostate cancers have greater TMB, indel and neoantigen burden compared with TMB-H/MSS prostate cancers, and these differences may contribute to more profound and durable responses to ICB.
