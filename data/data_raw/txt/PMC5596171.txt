MULTICENTER PHASE II STUDY OF TEMOZOLOMIDE AND MYELOABLATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY WITH AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL TRANSPLANT FOR NEWLY DIAGNOSED ANAPLASTIC OLIGODENDROGLIOMA

ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND

Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO) and anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (AOA) are chemotherapy-sensitive tumors with prolonged survival after radiochemotherapy. We report a prospective trial using induction temozolomide (TMZ) followed by myeloablative high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous stem-cell transplant (ASCT) as a potential strategy to defer radiotherapy.

METHODS

Patients with AO/AOA received 6 cycles of TMZ (200 mg/m 2 × 5/28 day). Responding patients were eligible for HDC (thiotepa 250 mg/m 2 /day × 3 days, then busulfan 3.2 mg/kg/day × 3 days), followed by ASCT. Genomic characterization was performed using next-generation sequencing.

RESULTS

Forty-one patients were enrolled; 85% had 1p/19q codeleted tumors. After induction, 26 patients were eligible for HDC-ASCT and 21 agreed to proceed. There were no unexpected adverse events or toxic deaths. After median follow-up of 66 months, 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) for transplanted patients was 86%, 5-year PFS 60%, and no patient has died. Among all 1p/19q codeleted patients ( N = 33), 5-year PFS was 50% and 5-year overall survival (OS) 93%, with median time to radiotherapy not reached. Next-generation sequencing disclosed typical oligodendroglioma-related mutations, including IDH1 , TERT , CIC , and FUBP1 mutations in 1p/19q codeleted patients, and glioblastoma-like signatures in 1p/19q intact patients. Aside from IDH1 , potentially oncogenic/actionable mutations were variable, depicting wide molecular heterogeneity within oligodendroglial tumors.

CONCLUSIONS

TMZ followed by HDC-ASCT can be safely administered to patients with newly diagnosed 1p/19q codeleted AO. This strategy was associated with promising PFS and OS, suggesting that a chemotherapy-based approach may delay the need for radiotherapy and radiation-related toxicities.
