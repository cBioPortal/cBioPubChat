WHOLE EXOME SEQUENCING OF ADENOID CYSTIC CARCINOMA

ABSTRACT

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy that can occur in multiple organ
sites and is primarily found in the salivary gland. While the identification of
recurrent fusions of the MYB-NFIB genes have begun to shed light on
the molecular underpinnings, little else is known about the molecular genetics of
this frequently fatal cancer. We have undertaken exome sequencing in a series of 24
ACC to further delineate the genetics of the disease. We identified multiple mutated
genes that, combined, implicate chromatin deregulation in half of cases. Further,
mutations were identified in known cancer genes, including PIK3CA , ATM , CDKN2A , SF3B1 , SUFU , TSC1 , and CYLD . Mutations
in NOTCH1/2 were identified in 3 cases, and we identify the negative NOTCH signaling
regulator, SPEN , as a new cancer gene in ACC with mutations in 5
cases. Finally, the identification of 3 likely activating mutations in the tyrosine
kinase receptor FGFR2 , analogous to those reported in ovarian and
endometrial carcinoma, point to potential therapeutic avenues for a subset of cases.
