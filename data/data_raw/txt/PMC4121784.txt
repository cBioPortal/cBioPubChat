COPY NUMBER ALTERATION BURDEN PREDICTS PROSTATE CANCER RELAPSE

ABSTRACT

Prostate cancer is a major health burden with significant overtreatment because of difficulty segregating high- and low-risk disease. Discovery of biomarkers that stratify risk could have a broad public health impact but requires cohorts with comprehensive molecular and clinical follow-up. We characterize two independent prostate cancer cohorts with genomic and clinical data that include biochemical recurrence and metastasis. We demonstrate that copy number alteration (CNA) burden, a measure of the fraction of a tumor genome that is copy number altered, is prognostic for recurrence and metastasis. CNA burden is also associated with cancer recurrence in an intermediate risk population, and can be identified in biopsies. This work provides a clinicogenomic resource and highlights oncogenomics' potential to identify needed prognostic factors.
