GENOME-WIDE ANALYSIS UNCOVERS NOVEL RECURRENT ALTERATIONS IN PRIMARY CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM LYMPHOMAS

ABSTRACT

PURPOSE

Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma confined to the CNS. Whether there is a PCNSL-specific genomic signature and, if so, how it differs from systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is uncertain.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

We performed a comprehensive genomic study of tumor samples from 19 immunocompetent PCNSL patients. Testing comprised array-comparative genomic hybridization and whole exome sequencing.

RESULTS

Biallelic inactivation of TOX and PRKCD were recurrently found in PCNSL but not in systemic DLBCL, suggesting a specific role in PCNSL pathogenesis. Additionally, we found a high prevalence of MYD88 mutations (79%) and CDKN2A biallelic loss (60%). Several genes recurrently affected in PCNSL were common with systemic DLBCL, including loss of TNFAIP3, PRDM1, GNA13, TMEM30A, TBL1XR1, B2M, CD58 , activating mutations of CD79B, CARD11 and translocations IgH-BCL6 . Overall, BCR/TLR/NF-ÎºB pathways were altered in >90% of PNCSL, highlighting its value for targeted therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, integrated analysis showed enrichment of pathways associated with immune response, proliferation, apoptosis, and lymphocyte differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS

In summary, genome-wide analysis uncovered novel recurrent alterations, including TOX and PRKCD , helping to differentiate PCNSL from systemic DLBCL and related lymphomas.
