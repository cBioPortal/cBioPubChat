GENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF ADENOID CYSTIC CARCINOMA OF THE
BREAST

ABSTRACT

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) is a rare type of triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC) characterized by the presence of the MYB-NFIB fusion gene. The molecular underpinning of breast AdCCs other than the MYB-NFIB fusion gene remains largely unexplored. Here we
sought to define the repertoire of somatic genetic alterations of breast AdCCs.
We performed whole exome sequencing, followed by orthogonal validation, of 12
breast AdCCs to determine the landscape of somatic mutations and gene copy
number alterations. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and
reverse transcription PCR were used to define the presence of MYB gene rearrangements and MYB-NFIB chimeric transcripts. Unlike common forms of TNBC, we found that AdCCs have a
low mutation rate (0.27 non-silent mutations/Mb), lack mutations in TP53 and PIK3CA , and display a
heterogeneous constellation of known cancer genes affected by somatic mutations,
including MYB, BRAF, FBXW7, SMARCA5, SF3B1 and FGFR2.
MYB and TLN2 were affected by somatic mutations in
two cases each. Akin to salivary gland AdCCs, breast AdCCs were found to harbor
mutations targeting chromatin remodeling, cell adhesion, RNA biology,
ubiquitination, and canonical signaling pathway genes. We observed that although
breast AdCCs had rather simple genomes, they likely display intra-tumor genetic
heterogeneity at diagnosis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the
mutational burden and mutational repertoire of breast AdCCs are more similar to
those of salivary gland AdCCs than to those of other types of TNBCs, emphasizing
the importance of histologic subtyping of TNBCs. Furthermore, our data provide
direct evidence that AdCCs harbor a distinctive mutational landscape and genomic
structure, irrespective of disease site of origin.
