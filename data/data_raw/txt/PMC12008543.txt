CIRCULATING TUMOR DNA AND RESPONSE TO CISPLATIN-BASED CHEMOTHERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA ENROLLED IN CALGB 90601 (ALLIANCE)

ABSTRACT

Among patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma receiving platinum chemotherapy, the baseline variant allele frequency in circulating tumor DNA and alterations in TERT , PIK3CA , and ERBB2 in cell-free DNA were associated with poor prognosis. The results suggest that these are potential noninvasive prognostic biomarkers for future clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION

Cisplatin-based chemotherapy remains part of the treatment paradigm for locally advanced and metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC). Although specific genomic features such as DNA damage response (DDR) genes such as ERCC2 have emerged as promising predictors of cisplatin sensitivity in nonmetastatic UC [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , no prognostic genomic features have been validated for the metastatic setting.

Bladder cancer is characterized by intratumoral, intertumoral, and temporal genomic heterogeneity [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] , such that matched mUC tumors before and after chemotherapy may share only 28.4% of mutations [7] . Such heterogeneity highlights the disadvantages of relying on archival tumor sequencing in mUC. Evaluation of circulating tumor (ct)DNA—the portion of plasma cell-free (cf)DNA originating from tumor [10] —can overcome these challenges via noninvasive sampling of multiple tumor sites in real time [11] .

In light of the critical knowledge gap pertaining to prognostic genomic features in mUC, we analyzed baseline cfDNA in a subset of patients from CALGB 90601 (Alliance), a phase 3 cooperative group trial of first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy for mUC. Among cases with sufficient archival tumor for DNA sequencing, genomic profiles from matched cfDNA and tumor were compared. We sought to clarify the significance of alterations in DDR genes such as ERCC2 as biomarkers of sensitivity to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, as well as the variant allele frequency (VAF) in ctDNA and other genomic features.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

A detailed description of the methodology is provided in the Supplementary material.

Patients in the study population participated in the National Cancer Institute–sponsored trial Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB, now part of the Alliance for Clinical Trials) 90601, a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial comparing gemcitabine/cisplatin plus either bevacizumab or placebo for mUC [12] . Patients with ≥5 ml of baseline plasma available were included in the current study. Participants signed an institutional review board–approved, protocol-specific informed consent document.

Baseline plasma samples and matched germline DNA were analyzed using MSK-ACCESS, a tumor-uninformed platform that examines mutations and copy-number alterations in 129 genes as well as select gene fusions and rearrangements [13] , [14] . MSK-ACCESS uses unique molecular indexes and has a depth of coverage of >15 000× that allows a detection threshold of 0.1% for allele frequency [14] . Matched archival tumor was sequenced using the MSK-IMPACT platform [15] .

The primary endpoint of CALGB 90601 was overall survival (OS). Progression-free survival (PFS) and response were secondary endpoints. In CALGB 90601, there was no statistically significant difference in OS or response between treatment arms, and no clinically meaningful difference in PFS [12] . Therefore, data from both arms were pooled for the current analysis. OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Associations of survival with clinical and genomic characteristics were analyzed via Cox proportional-hazards models.

To account for the nonlinear association of VAF with clinical endpoints and the impact of the upper tail of each patient’s VAF distribution, we examined PFS and OS as a function of the cube root–transformed 75th percentile (3√VAF 75pc) [16] . The aim of this transformation was to stabilize VAF variance and reduce the effect of extreme values and provide a more symmetric distribution to meet statistical model assumptions [17] .

Multivariable models were adjusted for Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 vs 1; patients with performance status ≥2 were excluded from CALGB 90601) and the presence versus absence of visceral metastases, as these are established prognostic factors for advanced UC [18] . Multivariable models examining PIK3CA and ERBB2 were also adjusted for ctDNA VAF. To adjust for multiple comparisons, p values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method, and a false discovery rate of 5% ( q < 0.05) was used to identify significant genes.

RESULTS

Of 506 patients enrolled between July 2009 and December 2014 in CALGB 90601, 212 (42%) provided consent for blood collection and had sufficient baseline plasma for inclusion in the current study, with cfDNA sequencing successful for 201 (95%) (Supplementary Fig. 1). The median cfDNA concentration was 0.74 ng/μl (interquartile range 0.45–1.48, range 0.09–27.2). The median cfDNA mass was 44.6 ng (interquartile range 27.1–88.8, range 5.3–1633.3).

The 201 patients included in the current study had similar baseline characteristics to the overall CALGB 90601 cohort ( Table 1 ). Median follow-up for patients alive at last follow-up was 70.6 mo in the cfDNA cohort and 76.3 mo original trial cohort. In the cfDNA cohort, median OS was 14 mo (95% confidence interval [CI] 13–18) for patients treated with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab compared to 16 mo (95% CI 15–18) for patients treated with chemotherapy plus placebo. Median PFS was 7.8 mo (95% CI 6.7–9.5) with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab versus 7.6 mo (95% CI 6.7–8.5) with chemotherapy plus placebo. These results are comparable to findings for the overall CALGB 90601 cohort, in which median OS was 15 mo versus 14 mo, and median PFS was 8.0 mo versus 6.7 mo with bevacizumab versus placebo, respectively.

Among the 201 patients in the current analysis, visceral metastases, poor performance status, and renal insufficiency were associated with shorter PFS and OS, as expected [18] . Treatment arm (bevacizumab vs placebo) was not associated with outcomes ( Supplementary Table 1 ).

Genomic alterations in significantly mutated genes as defined by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) bladder cancer cohort [20] , as well as other genes selected for biological relevance ( TERT , BRAF , BRCA1 , and MDM2 ), observed at a frequency of >2% in cfDNA for our cohort are shown in Fig. 1 A. Alterations in TERT (primarily the TERT promoter) were most frequent; FGFR3 alterations were detected in 19% of patients, consistent with prior studies [20] , [21] .

The mutation count indicates the number of patients with a mutation in that gene detected in either cfDNA alone, tumor alone, or in both cfDNA and matched tumor.

A subset of 107 patients (53%) in this cfDNA cohort had sequencing of matched archival tumors using the MSK-IMPACT platform [15] . Assessment of genomic regions covered by both the MSK-IMPACT and MSK-ACCESS cfDNA sequencing panels revealed that the percentage of patients with gene alterations pertinent to mUC were similar between cfDNA and matched tumor ( Fig. 1 B and Supplementary Table 2 ) and the TCGA cohort (Supplementary Fig. 2) [20] . However, in comparison to matched archival tumor, a higher rate of alterations was detected in cfDNA for several oncogenes, including PIK3CA (17% vs 13%), RB1 (14% vs 12%), ERCC2 (6.5% vs 4.7%), BRAF (5.6% vs 4.7%), and KRAS (5.6% vs 3.7%). While 57.1% ( n = 24) of DDR gene alterations were detected in both cfDNA and matched tumor tissue, 21.4% (n = 9) were detected in tumor alone, and 21.4% (n = 9) in cfDNA alone.

Oncogenic DDR gene alterations were identified in pretreatment cfDNA in 27 (13%) cases, including 11 ATM (5.5%); nine ERCC2 (4.5%); six BRCA1 (3%) and two BRCA2 (1%) alterations. One patient had oncogenic ATM and BRCA1 mutations.

Neither oncogenic DDR gene alterations nor alterations in other notable biological pathways were associated with response to chemotherapy ( Supplementary Table 3 ). Similarly, there was no statistically significant association between oncogenic DDR gene mutations and OS or PFS ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Although oncogenic alterations in the BRCA2 DDR gene in cfDNA were associated with shorter OS (univariable hazard ratio [HR] 6.06, 95% CI 1.45–25.3; p = 0.014), there were only two oncogenic BRCA2 alterations and the result would not be statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Stratification of DDR gene and pathway analyses by treatment arm (bevacizumab vs placebo) did not significantly alter the results ( Supplementary Table 4 ). Fig. 2 Associations of DDR genes and select functional pathways with (A,B) overall survival and (C) progression-free survival.

Assessment of the association of clinical outcomes with any cfDNA ERCC2 alteration ( n = 11, including ERCC2 variant of unknown significance) revealed no statistically significant association with OS (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.50–1.72; p = 0.8), PFS (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.46–1.58; p = 0.6), or response (a response occurred in 5/11 patients [45%] with any cfDNA ERCC2 alteration; p > 0.9). Notably, the statistical power of the DDR analysis was limited by a low frequency of oncogenic DDR gene alterations detected in cfDNA (13%). Oncogenic ERCC2 alterations in cfDNA were observed in only 4.5% of cases, compared to 11% in the TCGA cohort [20] .

Multiple measures of the ctDNA VAF were associated with shorter OS and PFS ( Table 2 ). To account for the nonlinear association of VAF with clinical endpoints and the impact of the upper tail of each patient’s VAF distribution, we examined 3 √VAF 75pc and identified an inverse relationship with OS and PFS ( Fig. 3 ). These associations persisted after adjusting for visceral metastases and performance status (OS: HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.26–5.00; p = 0.009; PFS: HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.02–4.67; p = 0.045) and did not significantly change after stratification by treatment arm ( Supplementary Tables 5 and 6 ).

Alterations in PIK3CA , ERBB2 , and TERT in cfDNA were associated with shorter OS, with HRs of 1.74 (95% CI 1.12–2.71; p = 0.014), 1.62 (95% CI 1.08–2.42; p = 0.019), and 1.74 (95% CI 1.12–2.71; p = 0.014), respectively, before adjusting for multiple comparisons (q values of 0.14, 0.14, and 0.032; Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 7 ).

After multivariable adjustment for visceral metastases, performance status, and 3 √VAF 75pc, the association with OS remained for PIK3CA alterations (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.20–3.04; p = 0.006) and ERBB2 alterations (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.08–2.49; p = 0.019). Concordance probability estimates (CPE) for models including PIK3CA and ERBB2 were 0.63 (95% CI 0.59–0.67) and 0.63 (95% CI 0.59–0.67), respectively.

TERT alterations remained associated with shorter OS after adjustment for visceral metastases and performance status (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.15–2.19; p = 0.005). TERT alterations were highly correlated with ctDNA VAF ( p < 0.001) and were therefore not included in a multivariable model with VAF because of collinearity. In models of OS adjusted for visceral metastases and performance status, inclusion of TERT alteration status versus 3 √VAF 75pc resulted in CPEs of 0.62 (95% CI 0.58–0.66) and 0.62 (95% CI 0.58–0.66), respectively.

There was an insufficient number of events in most biomarker groups to formally test for interactions with bevacizumab exposure. We conducted an exploratory assessment of bevacizumab exposure and TERT , since TERT promoter alterations were prevalent and associated with poor survival. However, there was no meaningful differential effect of bevacizumab on the association of TERT with clinical outcomes ( Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Fig. 4).

DISCUSSION

In a cohort of patients with mUC enrolled in a phase 3 trial, genomic alterations detected in pretreatment cfDNA were generally concordant with those in matched archival tumor. However, a numerically higher rate of alterations in several prominent oncogenes was detected in cfDNA. Although we did not detect a statistically significant association between clinical outcomes and DDR gene alteration, the statistical power was insufficient because of a low frequency of DDR gene alterations in this cohort. High VAF in pretreatment ctDNA was associated with short OS and PFS, and ctDNA alterations in the TERT promoter, PIK3CA , and ERBB2 were associated with shorter OS, independent of clinical prognostic factors. If further validated, these markers may serve to identify the patients most likely to benefit from clinical trials and novel treatment approaches.

Multiple studies have established DDR gene alterations as promising markers of cisplatin sensitivity in localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] . The most extensively validated DDR gene, ERCC2, is a nucleotide excision repair protein in which helicase domain alterations confer cisplatin sensitivity in orthotopic xenograft models [1] , [2] , [3] . Notably, statistical power in the current study was limited by a low frequency of DDR gene alterations detected in cfDNA ( n = 27, or 13%). Oncogenic ERCC2 alterations in cfDNA were observed in only nine cases (4.5%), compared to 11% in the TCGA [20] , and associations between ERCC2 and longer OS (HR 0.65; p = 0.3) and PFS (HR 0.58; p = 0.2) did not reach statistical significance. Ultimately, the completion of ongoing randomized trials to definitively clarify the value of DDR genes in the context of neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains crucial to the field (eg, NCT03609216 ).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study in mUC to demonstrate an association between high baseline VAF in ctDNA and shorter OS and PFS, even after adjusting for clinical prognostic variables. Notably, a recent cfDNA analysis from KEYNOTE-361 showed no statistically significant association between baseline maximum VAF in cfDNA and mUC outcomes after platinum-based chemotherapy [22] . However, there were some evidence of an association, and the findings in that study were limited by statistical imprecision and uncertainty, as the cfDNA analysis included only 125 patients. Furthermore, baseline VAF in ctDNA was prognostic for OS in other, more heterogeneous mUC cohorts ( n = 53 and 103) [23] , [24] . If validated, our findings highlight the potential utility of cfDNA for prognostication and clinical trial stratification.

TERT , PIK3CA , and ERBB2 are all implicated in bladder cancer biology and were associated with poor prognosis in our cohort. TERT promoter alterations occur in 73% of bladder tumors [25] and were associated with shorter survival when present in UC tumors in a cohort of patients with variable disease stages [25] . Our findings regarding PIK3CA corroborate a smaller analysis of mUC cfDNA that also found that PIK3CA alterations were associated with shorter OS [23] , although data on the prognostic significance of PIK3CA alterations in localized UC are mixed [26] . In muscle-invasive bladder cancer, ERBB2 missense mutations have been associated with excellent response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy; however, despite a pathologic complete response to chemotherapy, 3/11 patients with ERBB2 -mutant muscle-invasive bladder cancer in that study developed distant recurrence [27] . Ultimately, the prognostic significance of these biomarkers for UC requires further study and validation in both the localized and metastatic settings. The association of ERBB2 with poor OS observed in our analysis is especially pertinent given mUC response rates of 33–83% to regimens containing HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugates such as trastuzumab deruxtecan and disitamab vedotin [28] , [29] .

Enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab recently supplanted cisplatin-based chemotherapy as the preferred first-line therapy for mUC [30] , [31] . However, gemcitabine/cisplatin remains a crucial regimen for mUC, for example in the second line following enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab [30] , [31] . Therefore, the current findings remain highly relevant. In fact, the rapidly evolving therapy landscape for mUC compels the next generation of clinical trials to redefine the role of platinum chemotherapy in competition with other recently approved and investigational agents. Such trials would greatly benefit from stratification by prognostic cfDNA biomarkers, such as those explored in the current study if properly validated.

Our study has several limitations. First, only a subset of patients in CALGB 90601 had sufficient plasma for cfDNA analysis, raising potential for sampling bias. However, there were no observable clinical differences between our cfDNA cohort and the overall trial cohort. Second, while half of the patients in this cohort received gemcitabine/cisplatin (plus placebo), the other half received gemcitabine/cisplatin plus bevacizumab. However, there was no clinically meaningful impact of bevacizumab on outcomes in comparison to placebo [12] . Moreover, we stratified analyses by bevacizumab exposure and observed no significant difference in our findings. Finally, our cfDNA platform was limited to a panel of selected genes, and therefore genomic features outside the regions covered, as well as epigenomic and transcriptional features, could not be assessed [14] . While the panel covered multiple DDR genes, including ERCC2 [1] , [2] , [3] , it did not include all DDR genes [14] , [32] . However, the 129 genes covered by our New York State Department of Health–approved platform were selected on the basis of genomic data from >25 000 solid tumors to encompass the most recurrent oncogenic mutations and all clinically actionable genes in solid tumor oncology. The limited panel also allowed ultra-deep sequencing (depth of coverage >15 000×) to ensure de novo detection of low-frequency mutations down to a VAF of 0.5% [14] . Nonetheless, further study is warranted to investigate genomic and transcriptional features beyond those interrogated by our assay.

CONCLUSIONS

In an analysis of pretreatment cfDNA from a cohort of patients with mUC nested within a phase 3 trial of cisplatin-based chemotherapy, we found that detection of alterations in several notable oncogenes was more frequent in cfDNA than in matched archival tumor. We did not observe a statistically significant association between DDR gene alterations in cfDNA and clinical outcomes, but the analysis was underpowered because of a low frequency of DDR gene alterations. Higher VAF in ctDNA was prognostic for shorter OS and PFS, and alterations in the TERT promoter, PIK3CA , and ERBB2 in ctDNA were poor prognostic markers, even after adjusting for clinical factors. If validated, these biomarkers may guide clinical trial stratification and identify patients likely to benefit from investigational therapies.
