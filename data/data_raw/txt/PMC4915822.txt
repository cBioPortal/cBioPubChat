INTEGRATIVE GENOME ANALYSES IDENTIFY KEY SOMATIC DRIVER MUTATIONS OF SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER

ABSTRACT

Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive lung tumor subtype with poor survival 1 – 3 . We sequenced 29 SCLC exomes, two genomes and 15 transcriptomes and found an extremely high mutation rate of 7.4±1 protein-changing mutations per million basepairs. Therefore, we conducted integrated analyses of the various data sets to identify pathogenetically relevant mutated genes. In all cases we found evidence for inactivation of TP53 and RB1 and identified recurrent mutations in histone-modifying genes, CREBBP , EP300 , and MLL . Furthermore, we observed mutations in PTEN , in SLIT2 , and EPHA7 , as well as focal amplifications of the FGFR1 tyrosine kinase gene. Finally, we detected many of the alterations found in humans in SCLC tumors from p53/Rb1 -deficient mice 4 . Our study implicates histone modification as a major feature of SCLC, reveals potentially therapeutically tractable genome alterations, and provides a generalizable framework for identification of biologically relevant genes in the context of high mutational background.
