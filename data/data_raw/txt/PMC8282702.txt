INTRAHEPATIC CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA WITH LYMPH NODE METASTASIS: TREATMENT-RELATED OUTCOMES AND THE ROLE OF TUMOR GENOMICS IN PATIENT SELECTION

ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND:

Lymph node metastasis (LNM) drastically reduces survival after resection of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHC). Optimal treatment is ill-defined, and it is unclear if tumor mutational profiling can support treatment decisions.

METHODS:

Patients with liver-limited IHC with or without LNM treated with resection (N=237), hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) (N=196), or systemic chemotherapy alone (SYS) (N=140) at our institution between 2000–2018 were included. Genomic sequencing was analyzed to determine if genetic alterations could stratify outcomes for patients with LNM.

RESULTS:

For node-negative patients, resection was associated with the longest median overall survival (OS) (59.9 months, 95% CI: 47.2–74.31), followed by HAIC (24.9 months, 95% CI: 20.3–29.6), and SYS (13.7 months, 95% CI: 8.9–15.9) ( P <0.001). There was no difference in survival for node-positive patients treated with resection (median OS 19.7 months, 95% CI: 12.1–27.2) or HAIC (18.1 months, 95% CI: 14.1–26.6) ( P =0.560), however, survival in both groups was greater than SYS (11.2 months, 95% CI: 14.1–26.6) ( P =0.024). Node-positive patients with at least one high-risk genetic alteration ( TP53 mutation, KRAS mutation, CDKN2A/B deletion) had worse survival compared to wild-type patients, (median OS 12.1 months, 95% CI: 5.7–21.5, P =0.002), regardless of treatment. Conversely, there was no difference in survival for node-positive patients with IDH1/2 mutations compared to wild-type patients.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:

There was no difference in OS for patients with node-positive IHC treated by resection vs. HAIC, and both treatments had better survival than SYS alone. The presence of high-risk genetic alterations provides valuable prognostic information that may help guide treatment.
