CLONAL EVOLUTION OF CHEMOTHERAPY-RESISTANT UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA

ABSTRACT

Chemotherapy-resistant urothelial carcinoma (UC) has no uniformly curative therapy. Understanding how selective pressure from chemotherapy directs UC’s evolution and shapes its clonal architecture is a central biological question with clinical implications. To address this question, we performed whole-exome sequencing and clonality analysis of 72 UCs including 16 matched sets of primary and advanced tumors prospectively collected before and after chemotherapy. Our analysis provided several insights: (i) chemotherapy-treated UC is characterized by intra-patient mutational heterogeneity and the majority of mutations are not shared, (ii) both branching evolution and metastatic spread are very early events in the natural history of UC; (iii) chemotherapy-treated UC is enriched with clonal mutations involving L1-cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) and integrin signaling pathways; (iv) APOBEC induced-mutagenesis is clonally-enriched in chemotherapy-treated UC and continues to shape UC’s evolution throughout its lifetime.
