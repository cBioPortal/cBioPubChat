MAPK PATHWAY GENETIC ALTERATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH PROLONGED OVERALL SURVIVAL IN LOW-GRADE SEROUS OVARIAN CARCINOMA

ABSTRACT

PURPOSE:

To characterize the somatic mutational landscape, investigate associations between genetic alterations and clinical outcomes, and determine the prevalence of pathogenic germline mutations in low-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (LGSCs).

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:

Patients with LGSC tumors that underwent panel-based sequencing of up to 505 genes were identified. Data on somatic and germline mutations, copy number alterations, and clinicopathologic features, including age at diagnosis, platinum sensitivity, and overall survival (OS), were collected.

RESULTS:

Following central pathology re-review, 119 patients with LGSC were identified for analysis. One hundred ten (92%) had advanced-stage disease (stages III/IV). Somatic KRAS (33%), NRAS (11%), EIF1AX (10%), and BRAF (11%) alterations were the most common; mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway alterations were found in 60% (n=71) of LGSCs. KRAS mutations were significantly associated with age at diagnosis >50 years (p=0.02) and platinum-sensitive disease (p=0.03). On multivariate analysis, MAPK pathway alterations (p=0.02) and platinum sensitivity (p=0.005) were significantly associated with improved OS. Seventy-nine patients (66%) underwent germline genetic testing; 7 pathogenic germline mutations, including 1 bi-allelic MUTYH mutation (c.1187G>A (p.Gly396Asp)) and 6 mono-allelic alterations, were identified. Somatic loss of the wildtype allele (loss of heterozygosity) in the tumor at the locus of the germline mutation was only observed in the bi-allelic MUTYH mutation carrier. There were no germline BRCA1/2 mutations.

CONCLUSIONS:

This study showed MAPK pathway alterations in LGSC, including KRAS mutations, are independently associated with platinum sensitivity and prolonged survival. Germline data, which were limited, identified few pathogenic germline mutations in patients with LGSC.
