        <abstract id="Abs1">
          <p id="Par1">The genomic spectrum of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) progression from primary to relapse is not fully understood. In this pilot study, we explore the sensitivity of various targeted and whole-genome NGS platforms in order to assess the best genomic approach of using liquid biopsy in future prospective clinical trials. Moreover, we investigate 35 paired primary/relapsed RMS from two contributing institutions, 18 fusion-positive (FP-RMS) and 17 fusion-negative RMS (FN-RMS) by either targeted DNA or whole exome sequencing (WES). In 10 cases, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from multiple timepoints through clinical care and progression was analyzed for feasibility of liquid biopsy in monitoring treatment response/relapse. ctDNA alterations were evaluated using a targeted 36-gene custom RMS panel at high coverage for single-nucleotide variation and fusion detection, and a shallow whole-genome sequencing for copy number variation. FP-RMS have a stable genome with relapse, with common secondary alterations <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A/B</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MYCN,</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CDK4</italic> present at diagnosis and impacting survival. FP-RMS lacking major secondary events at baseline acquire recurrent <italic toggle="yes">MYCN</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic> alterations. FN-RMS acquire a higher number of new alterations, most commonly <italic toggle="yes">SMARCA2</italic> missense mutations. ctDNA analyses detect pathognomonic variants in all RMS patients within our collection at diagnosis, regardless of type of alterations, and confirmed at relapse in 86% of FP-RMS and 100% FN-RMS. Moreover, a higher number of fusion reads is detected with increased disease burden and at relapse in patients following a fatal outcome. These results underscore patterns of tumor progression and provide rationale for using liquid biopsy to monitor treatment response.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p id="Par2">Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) comprise a heterogeneous clinical and molecular group of high-grade sarcomas showing various degrees of myogenic differentiation. Despite significant progress in refining multimodality therapies, the survival of patients developing metastatic or relapsed disease is dismal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. This shortcoming also relates to the limited understanding of the genomic landscape evolution driving the metastatic progression or therapy relapse in RMS. Most previous genomic studies in RMS have focused on identification of molecular markers of prognostic impact, allowing for improved risk stratification and therefore guiding therapy intensity. Thus the presence of <italic toggle="yes">PAX3/7::FOXO1</italic> fusion and <italic toggle="yes">MYOD1</italic>-L122R mutation, indicative of alveolar or fusion-positive (FP-RMS), and spindle/sclerosing RMS histologies, respectively, trigger risk escalation. Additional genetic alterations, such as somatic <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations, have been found to correlate with worse survival in both FP and FN RMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, while the prognostic role of recurrent <italic toggle="yes">CDK4</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MYCN</italic> amplifications detected mainly in FP-RMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> remains to be further validated.</p>
        <p id="Par3">Given the increasing significance of molecular markers in RMS for both risk stratification and disease monitoring, it has become essential to adopt innovative approaches for their screening. Thus, recent technological advances have enabled genomic testing of circulating tumor-derived material released by tumor cells in the blood. The minimally invasive ‘liquid biopsies’ have many advantages, including overcoming the tumor heterogeneity and spatial limitations associated with tissue biopsies, as well as allow serial collection at multiple timepoints throughout the patient treatment and follow-up. As such, future applications of liquid biopsy may inform of real-time disease burden and treatment response, which will potentially change the approach in diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring. Moreover, large studies investigating the sensitivity of different RNA- or DNA-based NGS panels across various samples types (blood, bone marrow, etc.) have not been systematically conducted in RMS, in particular to assess the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) dynamics during patient therapy.</p>
        <p id="Par4">In this study we investigate genomic patterns of tumor progression in a well-annotated clinical and molecular cohort of FP and FN RMS, showing that FP-RMS exhibit relatively stable genomes at relapse, while secondary alterations present at diagnosis, i.e., <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A/B</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MYCN</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">CDK4</italic>, impacted survival. Moreover, we explore the sensitivity of various deep-targeted and shallow whole-genome NGS platforms to define the best genomic approach of using liquid biopsy in future prospective clinical trials. Thus, ctDNA analysis identifies diagnostic variants in most RMS patients, at presentation and progression, with higher fusion reads correlating with disease burden and relapse.</p>

          <p id="Par6">The MSK cohort included 10 FP-RMS and 10 FN-RMS. The median age was 14 years (range 0.6–24 years) for FP-RMS and 7.8 years (range 1.6–54 years) for FN-RMS. All samples were studied on MSK-IMPACT targeted DNA-based gene sequencing. For each patient at least two samples were investigated, most having paired primary and metastatic/relapsed tumor. Sixteen patients had one primary and one relapse sample analyzed, and remaining 4 (2 FN-RMS, 2 FP-RMS) had two different relapse samples tested. In FP-RMS, the <italic toggle="yes">FOXO1</italic> fusion was evaluated by Archer FusionPlex which showed <italic toggle="yes">PAX3::FOXO1</italic> fusion in 8 cases and <italic toggle="yes">PAX7::FOXO1</italic> fusion in 2.</p>
          <p id="Par7">The 15 patients from Institut Curie (IC) (8 FP-RMS, 7 FN-RMS) had a median age of 8.4 years (range 0.1–22 years) and 4.0 years (range 0.02–14 years), respectively. All cases with FP-RMS tumors showed a <italic toggle="yes">PAX3::FOXO1</italic> fusion by RNAseq. The genomic landscape of primary and relapse tumors was determined by either WES (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 11) or combined targeted DNA (Dragon panel) and WES (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4), with targeted sequencing on primary and WES on relapse.</p>
          <p id="Par8">Within the entire cohort, the median time from diagnosis to relapse was 1.3 years (range 0.2–4.9 years), with 40% metastatic and 60% loco-regional relapse. Most had high-risk features at diagnosis (71%), such as metastatic disease (31%), nodal involvement (54%), large tumors (69%), and unfavorable location (extremity or parameningeal, 37%). The remaining were intermediate risk (26%) and one patient was defined as low risk. All patients were treated following established protocol guidelines except one lacking treatment data and therefore excluded from survival analysis. None of the above variables were significantly different among the two cohorts, including similar OS and EFS by Kaplan–Meier curves. Overall the 5-year OS was 33%.</p>

          <title>Primary and metastatic/relapsed tumor samples—sequential genomic analysis</title>
          <p id="Par9">This analysis was conducted to evaluate the acquired mutational landscape upon drug failure and metastasis in RMS, to better define genomic outlines of relapse that can be monitored through liquid biopsy.</p>
          <p id="Par10">Among the FP-RMS cohort (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 18 patients), matched genomic data from at least two tumor samples was analyzed, including 10 MSK-IMPACT, 7 WES, 1 targeted Dragon/WES. In 16 patients the tumors had a <italic toggle="yes">PAX3::FOXO1</italic> fusion, while in 2 a <italic toggle="yes">PAX7::FOXO1</italic> fusion. Overall the genomic landscape was stable, with pathogenic or likely pathogenic alterations being identified in 51 cancer genes, with 9 (18%) of them showing alterations being recurrent across different samples (<italic toggle="yes">MYCN, CDKN2A/2B, CDK4, GLI1, AKT1, IGF2, MED12, NCOR2</italic>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Half of the patients acquired additional alterations at relapse compared to primary tumor (median, 1, range 0-5 alterations). FP-RMS had a median of 2 alterations in the primary and 3 at relapse (range 0–7). Two cases harbored only the <italic toggle="yes">FOXO1</italic> fusion at primary tumor and subsequently acquired up to 4 new alterations at relapse (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The most common recurrent alterations present at diagnosis, also designated as ‘secondary major alterations’, were mostly mutually exclusive: <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A/2B</italic> alterations (5/18, 28%, 4 homozygous deletions, 1 non-sense mutation associated with loss of heterozygozity), <italic toggle="yes">MYCN</italic> alterations, (4/18, 22%, 2 amplifications, 2 missense mutations), and <italic toggle="yes">CDK4</italic> amplifications (3/18, 17%, coamplified with <italic toggle="yes">GLI1</italic> in 2 tumors and <italic toggle="yes">MDM2</italic> in 1 tumor at 12q13-15 locus). In total 10 patients with such secondary major alterations (other than the fusion) in the primary tumor acquired zero or very few additional alterations at relapse (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, left subgroup). In contrast, 8 patients lacking major secondary genetic alterations in the primary tumors developed a higher number of additional alterations in the relapse/metastatic disease (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, right subgroup). Two tumors from this latter group acquired either <italic toggle="yes">CDK4</italic> amplification or <italic toggle="yes">MYCN</italic> alterations at relapse. <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic> deletions was the only other recurrent event which was only detected at relapse. The two tumors harboring the <italic toggle="yes">PAX7::FOXO1</italic> fusion transcript were associated with <italic toggle="yes">FOXO1</italic> amplification (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Oncoprint representation of SNV or CNV alterations in the entire FP-RMS cohort (37 samples, 18 patients).</title><p>Each sample represents a column and each gene query is listed in a row.

          <p id="Par11">We then tested the impact of several gene alterations on survival, including only alterations being recurrent accross different samples for the statistical analysis.

          <p id="Par12">In the FN-RMS cohort (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 17 patients) paired primary and relapse samples were tested by either targeted or whole exome sequencing, including 10 MSK-IMPACT, 6 WES, 1 targeted Dragon/WES. A total of 113 different genes were found to harbor either somatic pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Sixty alterations occurred at diagnosis and 133 alterations in the relapse (111% overall increase), with an average of 4.3 newly acquired alterations per patient (range 0–17) and 5.6 mutations per tumor sample (range 0–20). Two-thirds of the tumors (13/17) showed new genetic alterations in the relapsed tumors, with 4 tumors acquiring &gt;10 new mutations (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>

We tagged each timepoint to a specific clinical context: diagnosis, during first-line treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or surgery), follow-up, relapse, during second-line treatment, and palliative care. First, there was no correlation noted between cfDNA concentration variations and clinical context. Second, we used unique molecular identifiers (UMI) for fusion identification during deep panel sequencing, which allowed a quantitative comparison of ctDNA levels from various timepoints based on the read number. The results showed that the number of fusion reads was closely linked to the clinical context in all 7 FP-RMS. One of them is depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>. All cases had increased fusion reads number at higher disease burden timepoints as well as at relapse in patients following a fatal outcome (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). In 2 patients with sufficient timepoints available, VAF fluctuations of SNVs showed a trend towards higher ratios with increased disease burden and lower ratios during follow-up periods (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

        <p id="Par28">The overall survival for patients with recurrent RMS is extremely poor, with a heterogeneity of outcomes being observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Moreover, our current understanding on how tumors evolve in the context of standard of care therapy remains limited. Also undetermined is the potential causal link between somatic mutations at baseline diagnosis, including tumor mutational burden (TMB), and the risk for treatment resistance and relapse. These shortcomings come from the paucity of comprehensive genomic studies investigating sequential tumor samples along the oncologic progression. In this study, we undertake a longitudinal genomic analysis to comparatively investigate the clonal evolution upon metastatic disease or relapse in a group of FP-RMS and FN-RMS. The study follows a two-level approach. First, we seek to characterize the acquired mutation patterns upon drug failure and metastasis by targeted DNA sequencing or WES in order to define genomic outlines of relapse that can be monitored through liquid biopsy. Second, we use a multisample and multiplatform NGS strategy in liquid biopsies to define feasibility and best methodology approach for disease monitoring during clinical progression.</p>

In the current cohort, we show that the most common secondary genetic alterations in primary FP-RMS are <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> deletions (28%), <italic toggle="yes">MYCN</italic> alterations (28%), and <italic toggle="yes">CDK4</italic> amplifications (22%), mostly present at baseline diagnosis and found to have an impact on survival (both OS and PFS). It is important to highlight that the incidence of these alterations in our study is significantly higher than in other investigations, likely related to the nature of our cohort, restricted to patients who developed recurrence. Additional prospective large-scale studies are needed to confirm the prognostic value of these events in high risk, relapsed FP-RMS. Moreover, the impact of these secondary events in triggering relapse or resistance to therapy has not been investigated to date. Interestingly, in our cohort, tumors harboring these major secondary genetic alterations at diagnosis harbor no or very few acquired alterations at relapse, suggesting a potential mechanism in driving progression. This contrasts with FP-RMS lacking defined secondary hits that subsequently developed new genetic alterations in the recurrence. These observations remain intriguing and require further validation in a larger number of cases.</p>
        <p id="Par30">The genomic landscape of FN-RMS is more heterogeneous, with a number of potential genetic drivers being implicated in their pathogenesis, including alterations in tumor suppressor genes (<italic toggle="yes">BCOR, NF1</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>), <italic toggle="yes">RAS</italic> activating mutations or <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic> amplifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Here we report that the most common events are loss of function alterations in <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> (33% samples, 41% patients) and <italic toggle="yes">BCOR</italic> (24% samples, 30% patients). These alterations were reported at significantly lower rates in other series (7–15% range), likely due to our study design focusing on patients with relapsed FN-RMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Although some studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> found <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> homozygous deletions in 20–25% of FN-RMS, neither Shern et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> nor our results confirmed this finding. Among these alterations, only <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations have been associated with poor outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, however, no recurrent molecular alterations in our FN-RMS cohort correlated with survival. Similar to the FP-RMS subset, we show that FN-RMS acquire no or very few mutations at relapse if the primary lesions harbored one of the defined driver events (<italic toggle="yes">BCOR, NF1, FGFR1, RAS</italic>), except in the <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations setting. CN-profiles in FN-RMS show recurrent whole chromosomal gains (i.e., chr 3, 5, 8, 12, and 14) present from baseline, which recapitulate prior findings in the literature using low resolution cytogenetic methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, our mutational signature analysis comparing primary (pre-treatment) and recurrent (post-treatment) FP-RMS and FN-RMS cases show a defective DNA mismatch repair single base substitution signature only in recurrent FN-RMS, while being detected in both subsets of FP-RMS.</p>
        <p id="Par31">These results unveil certain mutation patterns present only at relapse in FN-RMS, including <italic toggle="yes">BAP1</italic> deletions (2/17, 12%) and <italic toggle="yes">SMARCA2</italic> missense mutations and frameshift deletions (4/17, 24% patients). SMARCA2 is a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin modulating complex, and together with SMARCA4 are mutually exclusive subunits responsible of its ATPase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Alterations in the SWI/SNF complex represent one of the most frequent somatic mutations in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. While further investigation is needed, these results suggest that alterations in the SMARCA2 unit may play a key role in FN-RMS relapse evolution.</p>
        <p id="Par32">A subset of RMS is driven by coexisting alterations in multiple genes suggesting an evolutionary selection of multiple subclones that may drive relapse or refractory disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Only one study to date has specifically investigated intratumoral heterogeneity among both FP-RMS and FN-RMS using whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The results showed significant heterogeneity in 10 of the 15 cases tested, with few mutations being detected in the ‘founding clone’, while additional subclones carried the majority of SNV detected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Moreover, the same study tested clonal evolution following treatment in two FN-RMS patients, investigating the mutational allele frequency (MAF) to distinguish de novo SNVs in the recurrent samples from mutations at low frequency in the primary tumor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Their results showed that in both patients, the major clone from the primary tumor was eliminated following initial line of therapy, while the minor clone from the primary acquired additional SNVs and evolved into two major clones at recurrence. This suggests that chemotherapy provides a selection pressure that favors enrichment of treatment-resistant clones over time. Our longitudinal sampling of diagnostic and recurrent tumors with ctDNA along the treatment course also detects the emergence of treatment-resistant clones harboring mutations with high VAF not detected in the earlier timepoints, but apparent in the ctDNA and tumor relapse following several courses of chemotherapy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Another study investigated clonal deconvolution and phylogenetic analyses using WGS and WES on multiregional tumor sampling in three common pediatric tumors, including RMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Their findings showed significant intratumoral genetic heterogeneity and a direct correlation between the number of clonal branching with risk of malignancy.</p>
        <p id="Par33">Liquid biopsies have recently gained popularity as minimally invasive, easy to perform, and repeatable approaches. Highly sensitive and specific methods to detect ctDNA are emerging in various cancer types for either single-nucleotide variations or whole-genome sequencing to establish copy-number changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, these investigations have mainly been performed in epithelial malignancy and remain exceedingly rare in RMS. Two recent publications focused on the detection feasibility in RMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and risk stratification in intermediate-risk RMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, while another mainly in isolating circulating tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. An additional study focusing on recurrent/refractory malignancies in pediatric and young adult patients, including RMS, found a 57% detection rate of SNV in circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) and matched tumor by WES, including a 76% rate of actionable alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, this study was limited to SNV detection and did not assess CNA or structural rearrangements, while other studies have specifically developed bioinformatic tools to detect them more accurately in pediatric sarcomas with low mutational burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par34">The current work is designed as a pilot study to evaluate the best genomic strategy that can be applied in clinical settings for using liquid biopsy in treatment monitoring. A comprehensive methodology of both translocation breakpoints and SNV detection by deep targeted sequencing, and CNV assessment by shallow whole-genome sequencing is employed to establish the feasibility and sensitivity of each platform applied on retrospectively available plasma or bone marrow aspirates. Overall, the results show a higher sensitivity using plasma derived from blood rather than bone marrow aspirates, with true-positive detection rates of 86% and 53%, respectively. We first confirm the high sensitivity of our combined approach in both FP and FN-RMS subtypes at diagnosis, being able to detect the <italic toggle="yes">PAX3::FOXO1</italic> fusion and SNVs in 100%, and CNVs in 86% of the cfDNA timepoints. Our tool efficiently detects gene-level copy number gains/amplifications in <italic toggle="yes">CDK4, MYCN</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">MDM2</italic>, or losses in <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BCOR</italic>. Similarly, in the relapse setting, 86% of FP-RMS and 100% FN-RMS were correctly confirmed to harbor such alterations. This data provides solid rationale to implement liquid biopsy in both RMS subtypes, using the two screening platforms, including the high coverage custom targeted DNA sequencing for detecting gene fusions and SNV, shallow WGS for CNV alterations.</p>
        <p id="Par35">Previous studies have described an apparent correlation between cfDNA concentration and clinical status and tumor size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, however, this was not evident in our results. Similarly, Andersson suggested that cfDNA levels may be misleading and could result in over- or under-estimation of tumor burden due to normal fluctuations and advised relying on somatic mutation detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Moreover, the ctDNA content in cfDNA appears to vary significantly between cancer types, with highest values being obtained in neuroblastoma compared to all sarcoma samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par36">Although fusion detection in FP-RMS has been previously investigated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, this collection is the largest longitudinal ctDNA sequencing effort to date. A somewhat similar approach in cfDNA was adopted by Klega et al. using a hybrid capture bait for a translocation-specific sarcoma sequencing (TranSS-Seq) assay, designed to detect oncogenic gene fusions as well as mutations in common tumor suppressor genes (<italic toggle="yes">TP53, STAG2</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Their TranSS-Seq detected ctDNA in 5 of the 7 FP-RMS tested, which were confirmed to harbor a <italic toggle="yes">PAX3::FOXO1</italic> fusion. Similarly, the study by Shah et al. using a CAPP-Seq targeted gene panel approach showed high sensitivity of detecting translocations in ctDNA of 3 FP-RMS samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Although digital droplet PCR and other tools may be more effective in detecting fusions, particularly in cases of low disease burden, our integrated genomic platform has the versatility to detect the presence of fusions, SNVs, and CNVs, offering a reliable conduit to overcome tumor heterogeneity. However, it may be more suitable for high-risk or high-disease burden setups, as previous studies suggested a correlation between lower risk and lack of ctDNA detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, which could not be interrogated in this analysis.</p>
        <p id="Par37">Notably, we demonstrate a correlation between fusion reads and clinical context, with a higher number of reads being detected in the presence of increased disease burden, while a lower read number was found in all FP-RMS showing treatment response (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 7). One limitation of our study design is the inability to specifically address if ctDNA can detect relapse before it is detected clinically or radiographically. However, in one patient the fusion read detection was concomitant with the diagnostic imaging of relapse, suggesting a potential role in monitoring clinical progression. This is particularly relevant as recent data suggest the need for innovative disease follow-up methods, as routine imaging has not demonstrated improved outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Moreover, these findings show correlations between the clinical context and SNV VAFs or CNV log2 ratios of ctDNA variant alterations. Prior direct correlations between clinical course and variant ctDNA levels have only been anecdotally assessed in RMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In contrast, this paradigm has been better established in other pediatric cancers such as Ewing sarcoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, and Wilms tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. While these findings are highly encouraging, one major bias is the retrospective nature of our sample collection and lack of a centralized processing of peripheral blood samples. The latter confounding factor led to exclusion of 4 cases (1 FP-RMS, 3 FN-RMS) for which no ctDNA could be detected in the 11 samples combined. A recent study revealed an association between ctDNA levels and unfavorable location and metastasis in RMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. A subsequent study focusing on intermediate-risk RMS demonstrated a correlation between clinical outcome and ctDNA detection at diagnosis, utilizing a tool similar to ours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par38">In summary, these findings support the benefit of future implementation of liquid biopsies for screening real-time disease burden and treatment response in both RMS subtypes. We show for the first time through a combined platform approach that ctDNA is a reliable tool in detecting <italic toggle="yes">PAX3::FOXO1</italic> fusion, SNVs and gene level copy number variation in both FP-RMS and FN-RMS. Our pilot investigation provides a rationale for implementing ctDNA analysis in a prospective international ancillary study for children and adults with frontline and relapsed RMS (FaR-RMS, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT04625907">NCT04625907</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. One goal relies in a prospective and systematic collection of peripheral blood samples for cfDNA extraction at each patient-care milestone to confirm its role in treatment response monitoring, therapeutic target identification, and relapse prediction. Furthermore, patients with RMS tumors showing alterations in <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A, CDK4</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">MYCN</italic> for FP-RMS and <italic toggle="yes">TP53, BCOR</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">RAS</italic> pathway for FN-RMS may benefit from a shorter time-lapse between cfDNA collections during follow-up. This study also demonstrates the feasibility and added value of trans-Atlantic collaborations, especially in pediatric sarcoma, often limited by their rare incidence for meaningful research. Moreover, the multiplatform approach highlights the reproducibility of these results.</p>

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and ethics committees at both institutions and all participants provided written informed consent to take part in the study (MSKCC IRB# 02-060, Institut Curie DATA210014). We included patients having a confirmed pathologic and molecular diagnosis of metastatic/relapsed RMS for whom sequential NGS data was available, in most cases including primary and relapse samples. Ten cases underwent molecular analysis as part of the European MAPPYACTS trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. All FP-RMS samples were confirmed for the presence of <italic toggle="yes">FOXO1</italic> fusion either by RNAseq (IC) or Archer FusionPlex (MSKCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. A total of 35 patients were selected from both institutions (20 from MSKCC, 15 from IC), which included both pediatric and young adults. Pathology reports and clinical charts were reviewed for the tumor size, treatment information, date and location of metastatic disease or relapse, last follow-up, and status of disease. As Children Oncology Group (COG) and European Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcoma Study Group (EpSSG) groups do not abide by the same risk stratification criteria, patients from the European sub-group were re-classified following the COG criteria allowing for a uniform data analysis. Approved treatment guidelines for this cohort were EpSSG-RMS2005 or MMT-95, D9602, D9802, D9803, ARST0331, ARST0431, ARST0531. To validate that the two patient cohorts have comparable outcomes, a statistical analysis was performed to estimate the median and its corresponding 95% CI for time-to-event data. Kaplan–Meier curves were compared using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify prognostic factors for overall survival and event-free survival.</p>

          <p id="Par40">Collected tumor samples were formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded for MSKCC patients and frozen tissues for IC patients. RMS diagnostic was validated for each tumor sample by pathologic assessment and tumor cellularity was estimated as &gt;20% for further analysis. Tumor cellularity was also inferred by bioinformatic analysis using Sequenza during WES<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Nucleic acids were extracted and quantified, and all samples were subject to QC before any further analysis with minimal requirement. Whole exome sequencing required 10-200 ng of DNA, while RNAseq required &gt;1 µg RNA of sufficient quality (integrity number (RIN) &gt; 4 and DV200 &gt; 50%). Peripheral blood was used to extract normal germline DNA for every patient.</p>
          <p id="Par41">Due to the retrospective nature of our study, there was an inconsistent pattern of blood or bone-marrow samples collection. 16 patients with available frozen EDTA tubes from at least one relevant timepoint were selected. Samples were centrifuged at 1000 × <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 10 min to obtain 0.5–2.0 mL plasma aliquots which were then frozen at −80 °C. Samples were obtained from different/key timepoints throughout their clinical care, allowing to dynamically assess the feasibility of monitoring somatic alterations such as gene fusions, SNV, or CNV in the plasma. The cfDNA was extracted by Automated QIAsymphony kit for circulating DNA (Qiagen<sup>®</sup> N.V., Venlo, Netherlands). The double-strand DNA (dsDNA) amount extracted varied depending on sample type. For blood, concentrations ranged from 2.7–383.7 ng/mL (median 47.4 ng/mL) while bone marrow samples concentrations ranged from 32.3–652.3 ng/mL (median 129.0 ng/mL). Samples were then assessed by nucleotide migration using cfDNA Screen Tape for 4200 TapeStation system (Agilent<sup>®</sup>) to provide a proportion between genomic (high molecular weight) DNA and cfDNA (expected 146 bp +/−20 bp). Size profiling revealed satisfactory cfDNA ratios for blood samples and expected high rates of contamination by genomic dsDNA (&gt;1 kb) for bone marrow samples and overall lower ratios of cfDNA due to the usage of previously uncentrifuged frozen EDTA tubes. Around 5–50 ng of circulating cfDNA were processed with the pre-capture kit XT-HS2 (Agilent<sup>®</sup>) according to the manufacturers’ protocol. As ctDNA is estimated around 160–170 bp, no DNA fragmentation step was needed and size selection was done for most samples with gDNA contamination. This method was used both for plasma from blood and bone marrow aspirates. Libraries for all samples were then processed and barcoded similarly, quantified, and then qualified with the D1000 DNA ScreenTape analysis kit according to manufacturer protocols (Agilent®).</p>

          <p id="Par55">The BAM files were obtained by alignment on the hg19 genome version and processed through our in-house pipeline. The data analysis was approached similarly to WES with prior filtering-out of overly recurrent variants, allelic ratios &lt;5% (unless on a described oncogenic hotspot or present in the primary tumor), and synonymous SNVs. In the eventuality that the same c. mutation was detected in tumor and liquid biopsy, no minimal allelic ratio was required.</p>
          <p id="Par56">Shallow whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for ctDNA CNV Detection.</p>
          <p id="Par57">Following library preparation (day1 of the XT-HS2 kit, Agilent®), yet prior to hybridization and capturing for the CHEWIE panel, a small portion of extracted cfDNA was used for shallow WGS. 2 × 100 bp paired-end shallow sequencing was performed using an Illumina Novaseq6000. Raw reads were mapped by BWA MEM (v0.7.17) onto hg19 human reference genome. Reads overlapping with the RMS custom panel described above were removed using bedtools (v2.30.0) to avoid bias during normalization, as the shallow whole-genome sequencing was performed simultaneously to the targeted panel deep sequencing, using the same barcodes. The resulting BAM files were indexed by SAMtools (v1.14). A first analysis was performed with IchorCNA (v0.2.0), which includes a 1 Mb size of detection window and subsequently followed by WisecondorX (v1.2.4), to create normalized bins (100 kb), log2 ratios, for smaller pre-selected alterations. The reference used for this analysis was a subset of 25 germline samples. Predicted copy number alterations were annotated with a list of genes (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 2767) frequently involved in cancer using bedtools.</p>
