        <abstract id="Abs1">
          <p id="Par1">Immunotherapy is used to treat almost all patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, identifying robust predictive biomarkers remains challenging. Here we show the predictive capacity of integrating medical imaging, histopathologic and genomic features to predict immunotherapy response using a cohort of 247 patients with advanced NSCLC with multimodal baseline data obtained during diagnostic clinical workup, including computed tomography scan images, digitized programmed death ligand-1 immunohistochemistry slides and known outcomes to immunotherapy. Using domain expert annotations, we developed a computational workflow to extract patient-level features and used a machine-learning approach to integrate multimodal features into a risk prediction model. Our multimodal model (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74–0.86) outperformed unimodal measures, including tumor mutational burden (AUC = 0.61, 95% CI 0.52–0.70) and programmed death ligand-1 immunohistochemistry score (AUC = 0.73, 95% CI 0.65–0.81). Our study therefore provides a quantitative rationale for using multimodal features to improve prediction of immunotherapy response in patients with NSCLC using expert-guided machine learning.</p>

        <p id="Par3">Immunotherapies blocking programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> to activate and reinvigorate cytotoxic antitumor T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> have rapidly altered the treatment landscape of NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In just 4 years, PD-1/PD-L1 pathway blockade (abbreviated as PD-(L)1) therapy has become a routine component of treatment for nearly all patients and is now being tested in earlier stages of lung cancer and in combination with other therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These treatments represent a potential for long-term, durable benefit for a subset of individuals with advanced lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Consequently, there is a need to develop predictive biomarkers.</p>
        <p id="Par4">Multiple independent analyses have pinpointed individual baseline clinical features as potential independent predictors of response (such as antibiotic use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, systemic steroid use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio at diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>), individual genomic alterations (including mutations in <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and <italic toggle="yes">STK11</italic> (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>)) and densities of intratumoral cytotoxic T-cell populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Currently there are only two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy in NSCLC: tumor PD-L1 expression assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and tumor mutation burden (TMB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>; however, they are only modestly helpful. For example, PD-L1 expression only modestly distinguished long-term response in the 5-year overall survival (OS) report of Keynote-001 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>).</p>
        <p id="Par5">In contrast to previous approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, we sought to develop a model that integrates and synthesizes multimodal data routinely obtained during clinical care to predict response to immunotherapy. Patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC undergo standard-of-care tests, which generate valuable data such as PD-L1 expression patterns in diagnostic tumor biopsies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and radiological computed tomography (CT) images used in the staging of lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The raw data from these modalities are amenable to automated feature extraction with machine learning and image analysis tools. Accordingly, machine-learning-based integration of these modalities represents an opportunity to advance precision oncology for PD-(L)1 blockade by computing patient specific risk scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Previous work on automated deep-learning methods to predict immunotherapy outcomes from CT scans has shown predictive capacity from specific lesion types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. One previous study uses CT scans, laboratory data and clinical data to predict NSCLC immunotherapy outcomes, but incorporates only <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> mutational status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. However, in general, the relative predictive capacity of unimodal histology, radiology, genomic and clinical features compared to an integrated model remains poorly understood. This is in part due to a lack of datasets with multiple modalities available from the same set of patients from which systematic evaluation can be undertaken. Here, we present a multidisciplinary study on a rigorously curated multimodal cohort of 247 patients with NSCLC treated with PD-(L)1 blockade to develop a dynamic deep attention-based multiple-instance learning model with masking (DyAM), to predict immunotherapy response. We present a quantitative evaluation and predictive capacity of an adaptively weighted multimodal approach relative to the unimodal features derived from histology, radiology, genomics and standard-of-care approved biomarkers.</p>

          <p id="Par9">Standard clinical biomarkers, including PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) and TMB were significantly different between responders and nonresponders in the multimodal cohort; however, classification models using these features were unable to completely separate the two groups (TPS, AUC = 0.73, 95% CI 0.65–0.81; TMB, AUC = 0.61, 95% CI 0.52–0.69; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Thus, we assembled routinely collected clinical information, CT scans, digitized PD-L1 IHC in tissue containing NSCLC and genomic features from the MSK-IMPACT clinical sequencing platform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> for the multimodal cohort. We used these data to establish a multimodal biomarker. We first quantified the predictive capacity of each modality individually, before assembling all available data into a multimodal biomarker to build an algorithm predictive of response (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). We performed tenfold cross-validation to obtain model predictions for the entire multimodal cohort by merging results from the test sets (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>).</p>

          <title>CT features only modestly separate responders</title>
          <p id="Par10">Of 247 patients, 187 (76%) had disease that was clearly delineated and separable from adjacent organs. These 187 patients included 163 (87%) with lung parenchymal lesions, 21 (11%) with pleural lesions and 67 (36%) with pathologically enlarged lymph nodes. For each patient, up to six lesions were segmented and site-annotated by three board-certified thoracic radiologists (N.H., A.P. and J.A-F.). To ensure consistency in CT protocols, our analysis was limited to chest imaging with contrast. The mean segmented volume for lung parenchymal, pleural and nodal lesions was 24 (range 0.14–50, interquartile range (IQR) 15–48), 12 (range 0.31–209, IQR 16–26) and 9.4 (range 0.82–42, IQR 37–67) cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. We extracted robust features from the original radiologist segmentations that were augmented by superpixel-based perturbations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>). Principal-component analysis (PCA) of all radiomics features of the original and perturbed segmentations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) showed lesion-wise similarity, indicating broad preservation of the underlying texture and significant differences in the principal component by lesion type. The similarity of radiomics features by lesion type across patients motivated building site-specific classification models. L1-regularized logistic regression (LR) models selected an average of 35, 10 and 25 features from lung parenchymal, pleural and nodal lesions, respectively, which we used for downstream prediction of immunotherapy response (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). The logistic model built from features derived from pleural nodules alone was unsuccessful outside of training data (AUC = 0.28, 95% CI 0.04–0.52) compared to lung parenchymal nodules (AUC = 0.64, 95% CI 0.54–0.74) and pathologically enlarged lymph nodes (AUC = 0.63, 95% CI 0.49–0.77). The model based on enlarged lymph nodes did not consistently converge, with over 20% of models performing worse than random chance with repeated subsampling. We aggregated the average individual lesion predictions to construct patient-level response predictions, which resulted in an overall AUC = 0.65 and 95% CI 0.57–0.73. We also developed an alternative model that analyzed all lesions from each patient without separation into categories using multiple-instance learning, which resulted in similar, albeit lower, performance (AUC = 0.61, 95% CI 0.52–0.70).<fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Extraction of CT radiomics features and association with response.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Radiomics feature extraction pipeline using expert segmented thoracic CT scans.

          <p id="Par11">CT-based predictions of response were validated in the radiology cohort, consisting of 50 patients (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) with expert segmentation, resulting in 40 lung parenchymal lesions, 8 pleural lesions and 22 enlarged lymph nodes. The predictive ability from features extracted from the lung parenchymal lesions (AUC = 0.66, 95% CI 0.48–0.84) was consistent with the multimodal cohort (AUC = 0.64, 95% CI 0.54–0.74), as were the averaging (AUC = 0.55, 95% CI 0.37–0.73) and multiple-instance learning-based aggregation models (AUC = 0.65, 95% CI 0.44–0.87). Taken together, discriminating clinical end points by CT-derived features was modest and primarily driven by texture in the lung parenchymal lesions; however, lesion-specific feature extractions were propagated for use in the multimodal model, where relative contributions to predictive capacity were evaluated.</p>

          <title>PD-L1 texture features approximate pathologist assessments</title>
          <p id="Par12">We next studied digitized pre-treatment PD-L1 IHC performed on tumor specimens meeting quality control standards (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 201 patients (81%)). A total of 105 (52%) tumor slides showed positive PD-L1 IHC staining (TPS ≥ 1%) and were used to extract IHC texture, a characterization of PD-L1 IHC based on the spatial distribution of expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). IHC texture was composed of features with a wide range of statistical association to immunotherapy response (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The most predictive feature, skewness of the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) autocorrelation matrix, correlated with both TPS and PFS (AUC = 0.68, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>TPS</sub> = −0.38, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>PFS</sub> = 0.17, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 105). The maximum, median and minimum of autocorrelation (a measure of the coarseness of the texture of an image) skewness corresponded broadly with PD-L1 IHC stain intensity as well as with contrast and edges in PD-L1 intensity between cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Additional significant features from the LR fit included cluster shade skewness and Imc2 kurtosis, which were less sensitive to the overall PD-L1 stain intensity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Furthermore, distributions of GLCM autocorrelation were significantly and inversely associated with pathologist-assessed PD-L1 TPS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>) indicating automated feature extraction with IHC texture could approximate expert thoracic pathologist assessment. LR modeling using 18 features based on the autocorrelation matrix and statistics of the pixel intensity distribution (IHC-A) resulted in prediction accuracy of AUC = 0.62 (95% CI 0.51–0.73), which was comparable to lesion-wide radiological averaging (AUC = 0.65, 95% CI 0.57–0.73), but inferior to the pathologist-assessed PD-L1 TPS (AUC = 0.73, 95% CI 0.65–0.81) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). While including TPS and IHC-A features reduced the AUC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>), other classifier performance metrics including accuracy, recall and F1-score increased (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

          <title>Multimodal integration via deep-learning improves prediction</title>
          <p id="Par15">Having evaluated predictive capacity of unimodal features, we next implemented the DyAM model to evaluate the impact of combining features from radiology, histology and genomics in predicting response to PD-(L)1 blockade (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). The DyAM model outputs include risk attributed to each modality (partial risk score), attention the modality receives (attention weight and share) and the overall score. DyAM has the practical quality of masking modalities in a given patient with no characterization, such as a tumor with negative PD-L1 expression or no segmentable disease in their CT scan. The performance of multimodal integration was assessed using Kaplan–Meier analysis whereby stratification based on multimodal DyAM was more effective at separating high- and low-risk patients than the standard clinical biomarkers of PD-L1 TPS and TMB (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Using this framework, we then systematically compared unimodal features and various combinations of bimodal and multimodal features (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>, F1, precision and recall scores shown in Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, model coefficients are shown in Extended Data Figs. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">2</xref>–<xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). In general, layering complementary feature sets improved performance both within and between modalities. For example, DyAM integration of site-specific radiologic features improved prediction from AUC = 0.65, 95% CI 0.57–0.73 to AUC = 0.70, 95% CI 0.62–0.78. Furthermore, a bimodal DyAM model integrating radiological data and PD-L1-derived features (both TPS and IHC texture) resulted in AUC = 0.68 and 95% CI 0.61–0.75, whereas the combination of PD-L1 and genomic features resulted in AUC = 0.72 and 95% CI 0.65–0.79. Combining radiologic and genomic features resulted in the highest bimodal performance (AUC = 0.76, 95% CI 0.69–0.83). Each of these bimodal features improved on either unimodal feature set alone. The best performing, fully automated approach, using three modes of data included IHC-G features, with an AUC = 0.78 (95% CI 0.72–0.85). Finally, using three modes of data with the PD-L1 TPS score resulted in the highest accuracy with AUC = 0.80, 95% CI 0.74–0.86. This was in contrast with averaging the LR scores from all modalities (AUC = 0.72, 95% CI 0.65–0.79). All multimodal DyAM results were significantly higher than null hypothesis AUCs obtained via permutation testing.<fig id="Fig5" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>DyAM-based unimodal and multimodal prediction of response.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, DyAM was used for multimodal integration.

          <p id="Par16">We then compared the DyAM model to established biomarkers of immunotherapy response as well as clinical confounders using multivariable Cox regression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). The resulting overall score, DyAM risk, was used as input to a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model with derived neutrophil-to lymphocyte ratio (dNLR), pack-years smoking history, age, albumin, tumor burden, presence of brain and liver metastases, tumor histology and scanner parameters.

When comparing the classifier performance against the LR risk scores, only the integrated model was significant (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). We divided the cohort into quartiles using the DyAM score and performed corresponding Kaplan–Meier analysis, focusing on PFS in the first 12 months to highlight the potential of DyAM to separate response groups early after treatment. Progression at 4 months was 21% for the lowest (protective) quartile and 79% for highest (risk) quartile (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), compared to 30% and 60% for the averaging method. Finally, we assessed the effect of reweighting individual data modalities (attention analysis, alpine plots) on the overall model performance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). In patient subsets with the data modality present, we observed that the removal of lung parenchymal nodule CT texture and genomic alterations had the greatest effect on AUC, whereas the model was robust to the removal of IHC texture and PD-L1 TPS. Non-linear relationships between data modalities indicate an effect of the weighting scheme used within DyAM. At 4 months, the ratio of progression events between the lower and higher quartiles was 3.8 (95% CI 3.7–4.0), which decreases sharply when removing either the CT texture (decreasing to 3.2 (95% CI 3.1–3.3)) or genomic alterations (decreasing to 2.3 (95% CI 2.2–2.4)); however, this early separation did not manifest from either modality in isolation. Model performance decreases for all modes as unimodal attention increases and the DyAM model outperformed simple averaging.<fig id="Fig6" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>DyAM-based multimodal analysis.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, HRs and single feature AUCs of covariates.

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p id="Par17">The integration of biomedical imaging, histopathology and genomic assays to guide oncologic decision-making is still in a preliminary phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Herein, we show that machine-learning approaches that automatically extract discriminative features from disparate modalities result in complementary and combinatorial power to identify high- and low-risk patients with NSCLC who received immunotherapy. Our study represents a proof of principle that information content present in routine diagnostic data, including baseline CT scans, histopathology slides and clinical next-generation sequencing can be combined to improve prognostication for response to PD-(L)1 blockade over any one modality alone and over standard clinical approaches. Integration of these data presents technical difficulty and infrastructure cost; however, our results indicate the potential of integrative approaches. To enable growing interest in deploying data infrastructure to automate the collection, organization and featurization of the data included in this study, the workflows and software are provided for use by the broader community in other cohorts and can be applied beyond NSCLC to other cancers and diseases.</p>
        <p id="Par18">To enable the study, we consulted domain-specific experts to curate features in our dataset. Curation involved segmentation of malignant lesions within CT scans by thoracic radiologists (such as those shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) and annotation of digitized PD-L1 IHC slides (such as those used to train the machine-learning classifier to compute the tumor segmentation mask in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) and adjudication of PD-L1 expression by a thoracic pathologist. We also limited genomic and clinical features to those with known associations with NSCLC and immunotherapy outcomes. Heterogeneity of the disparate data modalities presented a unique challenge in their integration, such as, patients with non-segmentable disease or PD-L1-negative tumors, for which PD-L1 expression patterns are not defined. Finally, the most optimal combination of these features is not known and post-fit linear combination or averaging techniques could ignore interactions and correlations between these modalities. The attention gate of DyAM allows for non-linear behavior across the input modalities. The use of attention gating and the generation of partial risk scores has added benefit; it allows for higher-level analysis of multimodal data, such as automatically identifying regions of feature space where certain modalities are more or less predictive. The result was an interpretable, data-driven multimodal prediction model that was also robust to missing data. Reassuringly, the multimodal DyAM model that we derived was not only able to predict short term objective responses better than any modality separately or linearly combined, but also led to enhanced separation of the Kaplan–Meier survival curves that reflected discriminative power within the first few months. This is further evidence that our model could achieve early stratification of true responders from nonresponders, an important criterion for predictive biomarkers and future clinical management decisions. Furthermore, our attention analysis of the DyAM model revealed that all data modalities (radiomics, genomics and pathology) are drivers of this early stratification.</p>
        <p id="Par19">A limitation of our analysis was the size of the multimodal cohort assembled and the restriction to a single center. To ensure consistent training data quality, we chose to include only CT scans that were performed within one institution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Inclusion of CT scans from external institutes warrants further study to investigate the effect of various CT imaging protocols and machine-acquisition parameters on model sensitivity. Digitized PD-L1 IHC slides were similarly chosen from a single center, given differences in staining quality among different laboratories and the use of several different antibodies in clinical practice among institutions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Similarly, existing commercial and institution-specific targeted next-generation sequencing panels differ in breadth of coverage and germline filtering techniques, which can introduce challenges for data integration and not all institutions sequence patient-matched healthy specimens to identify germline mutations. These challenges can be mitigated by training models with data from multiple sites to either predict clinical outcomes directly or to perform segmentation in pathological or radiological imaging for downstream analysis; however, a multisite training strategy requires comparable dataset sizes across sites with consistent and rigorous annotations to properly normalize models for heterogeneity and extract robust features. The inclusion of multiple malignancies and imaging modalities could also improve model generalizability, as shown in a multi-institution study involving 1,682 patients by Wu et al. in which robust radiomic signatures were found across three malignancies and two imaging modalities, including one associated with improved survival in immunotherapy-treated NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Federated learning may provide a principled solution to this challenge; however, its practical use is at very early stages of adoption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Although we were unable to obtain an external validation cohort given the complexity of the data modalities, internal single modality validation cohorts for CT scans and histopathology slides were used as full hold-out sets to validate the findings from the multimodal cohort. Indeed, the models with significant and robust performance in the multimodal cohort showed stable performance in the radiology and pathology cohorts. Despite our best efforts, underperforming models encounter statistical limitations that can be best minimized with further data collection. In addition, we have released all code as open-source software and provide our research-ready datasets for others to reproduce our results, validate the findings at other institutions and ideally extend and further refine our methods.</p>
        <p id="Par20">Incorporation of external data would have also required substantial data assembly, including identification of a cohort of immunotherapy-treated patients with NSCLC with associated RECIST outcomes, CT scans, digitized PD-L1 IHC slides and genomic alterations. Once assembled, scaling and extending our model to incorporate external data would require annotation algorithms to segment CT scan lesions or distinguish tumor from healthy tissue in PD-L1 IHC slides to reduce expert burden. Alternatively, large de-identified datasets from many sites may overcome the need for manual annotation by developing reliable deep-learning models on unannotated data, which can be directly included as part of the DyAM model. In the future, assembly of large well-annotated multi-institutional training datasets will lead to development of robust multimodal classifiers that serve as powerful biomarkers. These decision aids could be integrated into routine clinical care and used to quickly and precisely distinguish responders and nonresponders.</p>
        <p id="Par21">A deeper understanding of features extracted from the data modalities and their relationships to known functional cancer pathways could also aid in feature selection. For example, radiomics characterizations involve the extraction of thousands of features that can be used together to broadly encapsulate intratumoral heterogeneity, but there have been few studies using correlative molecular data to infer functional relationships. This task is further complicated by the fact that many radiomics features are correlated to each other. One study used gene set expression analysis and found an association between radiomics and cell-cycle progression and mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Similarly, correlative molecular data could aid in a more principled selection of features that comprise our PD-L1 IHC texture characterization. Even without molecular data, robust associations between radiological and histological phenotypes, such as those found by Jiang et al., could be a step toward more efficient feature selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par22">Other limitations of our analysis include the use of RECIST-derived response end points and the date of the tissue used to assess PD-L1 expression. RECIST outcomes were used instead of directly predicting survival metrics because RECIST criteria are standardized and represent the best proxy in quantifying early treatment response. Additionally, using RECIST outcomes minimize effects from confounders such as indolent disease, future lines of therapy and death unrelated to NSCLC; however, RECIST responses are characterized via measuring tumor size changes on CT scans, which do not fully encompass biological treatment response. With improved biological insight leading to better response metrics, future studies will be needed to refine predictive models. While CT scans are proximal to immunotherapy, PD-L1 expression is often assessed on tissue from the initial diagnosis. This is not ideal as previous treatments can modify the tumor microenvironment, including PD-L1 expression. Our cohort consisted mostly (68%) of patients who received one or more previous lines. While we consider the number of lines of therapy before immunotherapy as a covariate, changes in PD-L1 expression due to previous treatments are not explicitly taken into account.</p>
        <p id="Par23">Our results serve as a proof of principle for the value of multimodal integration. We show that existing data from multiple cancer diagnostic modalities can be annotated, abstracted and combined using computational and machine-learning methods for next-generation biomarker development in NSCLC immunotherapy response prediction. Our DyAM model is a promising approach to integrate multimodal data and future models using larger datasets will make it possible to augment current precision oncology practices in treatment decision-making.</p>

          <p id="Par26">The multimodal cohort was formed using the following inclusion criteria: patients with stage IV NSCLC who initiated treatment with anti-PD-(L)1 blockade therapy between 2014 and 2019 at the study institution who had a baseline CT scan, baseline PD-L1 IHC assessment and next-generation sequencing by MSK IMPACT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Patients who received chemotherapy concurrently with immunotherapy were not included. Overall, 247 patients met the inclusion criteria for the training cohort. The multimodal cohort (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) was 54% female with a median age of 68 years (range 38–93 years). Overall, 218 (88%) patients had a history of smoking cigarettes (median 30 pack-years, range 0.25–165). Histological subtypes of NSCLC included 195 (79%) adenocarcinomas, 37 (15%) squamous cell carcinomas, 7 (3%) large cell carcinomas and 8 (3%) NSCLC, NOS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Collectively, 169 (68%) patients received one or more lines of therapy before starting PD-(L)1 blockade and 78 (32%) patients received PD-(L)1 blockade as first-line therapy, of which 14 (6%) received therapy in the context of a clinical trial.</p>

          <p id="Par29">Our study was limited to chest imaging to ensure homogeneity of the imaging protocol used. As a result, we only considered chest lesions. Lesion segmentation of primary lung cancers and thoracic metastases was performed manually by three radiologists (N.H. and J.A-F. with 8 years of post-fellowship experience and A.P. with 1 year of post-fellowship experience). Each lesion was segmented by a single radiologist, reviewed by a second and disagreements were resolved with a third.

          <p id="Par30">Target lesions were selected in accordance with RECIST v.1.1 criteria (maximum of five target lesions and up to two target lesions per organ).

Lung and soft tissue windows (window level, −600 HU and width, 1,500 HU and window level, 50 HU and width, 350 HU, respectively) were used when appropriate to visually delineate volumes of interest from lung tissue, large vessels, bronchi and atelectasis.

Areas of ambiguity, such as image artifacts from surgical staples, were excluded. A total of 337 lesions from 187 patients, classified into lung parenchymal, pleural and lymph nodes were segmented. The predictive capacity of features extracted from lesions segmented CT scans were analyzed. A variety of radiomics features were computed using all filters available in the pyradiomics Python package v.3.0.1 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>), resulting in 1,688 features. To ease the training of the predictive model, the number of features were reduced by requiring stability with respect to small perturbations of the original segmentation using the method previously used by Zwanenburg et al. to assess robustness of radiomics features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In this method, the original segmentation is perturbed ten times, then radiomic features are computed from each perturbation. We defined a robustness <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> score, which is the ratio of the average inter-lesion variance across the ten perturbations and the feature intra-lesion variance average across the entire multimodal cohort. This value ranges 0–1 and we considered only features with <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> scores less than 0.15. This ensured that, on average, selected features only vary slightly (~15%) across the perturbations with respect to its total dynamic range. The same procedure was implemented in the analysis of the radiology cohort. Investigators were blinded to patient response in the segmentation of the CT scans.</p>

Attention-based pooling as developed by Ilse et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> extended the multiple-instance learning paradigm to assign attention-based weights to each instance, which are a function of the instance features and optimized for prediction of an outcome. This technique is designed for an unfixed number of input instances with fixed feature size, such as the 1–5 texture feature vectors for each lesion encountered in the radiology analysis. The final output score is a weighted sum of the same LR model applied for each lesion, where the weights are dynamically determined. In the single-lesion case, we were able to recover similar results as compared to the standard LR. This technique treats each instance equally as there is a single set of parameters shared across all instances.</p>
          <p id="Par39">The model was developed and fit using pytorch v.1.8.0, with a hidden size of 32, balanced class weights, binary cross-entropy loss, 0.005 learning rate, 250 steps and L2 regularization of 0.005 using the Adam optimizer.</p>

          <title>Multimodal dynamic attention with masking</title>
          <p id="Par40">Multiple-instance learning typically involves a single group or bag, of homogenous instances; however, in the multimodal case we encounter heterogenous instances. Furthermore, even though the textures derived from each lesion are the same shape, lesions in different sites may map to the predictor in different ways, such that a shared set of parameters may not be optimal. We thus encounter a MIL paradigm where we have a fixed-sized bag of heterogeneous instances or modes. For this study, the modes of data utilized were one-dimensional feature vectors derived from PD-L1 IHC performed on diagnostic tissue, segmented radiological CT scans delineated by lesion site and genomic alterations. We utilized the same dynamic pooling scheme in our model. Each input mode has its own set of trainable parameters: one to map the input vector to the label (risk parameters) and one to map the input vector to an attention score (attention parameters), which competes with the other input modes in a similar way to the standard multiple-instance learning model. As attention-based weights are trainable, the model learns which input modes are most relevant to treatment response. In contrast to multiple-instance learning, the final output score is a weighted sum of individually optimized LR models applied for each modality; this technique treats each mode specifically, while still optimizing all parameters in concert. Finally, as zero attention corresponds to a modality having no correspondence to the predictor, this model was expanded by adding a masking function that sets any missing mode’s attention to zero to address missing data (such as non-segmentable disease in CT). We call this the DyAM model.</p>
          <p id="Par41">The model was developed and fit using pytorch v.1.8.0, with balanced class weights, binary cross-entropy loss, 0.01 learning rate, 125 steps and L2 regularization strength of 0.001 using the Adam optimizer. When only one input modality was present, the attention gate was disabled to reduce complexity.</p>

          <title>Statistical analysis</title>
          <p id="Par44">There were no formal sample size calculations performed in advance. The multimodal cohort was selected based on the existing number of patients at MSK who met all inclusion criteria. Group comparisons were performed using two-sided Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic>-tests. AUC was used as a measure of performance of a biomarker on predicting response versus nonresponse. We performed tenfold cross-validation where scores from the validation folds were combined to form predictions across the entire multimodal cohort. Patients were randomly sorted into the folds. All feature selection and feature rescaling was performed on the training fold in each iteration of the cross-validation analysis. The binary cutoff used to determine the predicted response was determined for each patient using only training data. Hyperparameters were established from the first fold and applied consistently for each model. To explicitly evaluate the sensitivity of model fitting to the data used for training, we also performed a subsampling analysis where the data was randomly sampled 100 times using 90% for training and the remaining 10% for testing. All models were trained in an end-to-end manner with corresponding cross-validation across folds (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">9</xref>) and subsampling (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). We also report the F1-score, precision and recall for all models in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Model coefficients are shown in Extended Data Figs. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">2</xref>–<xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was developed with the Lifelines Python package v.0.25.7 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>) to compare the performance of this model to existing biomarkers and calculate adjusted HRs. The Lifelines package was used to compute survival curves estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. All statistical tests were two-sided with a significance level of 2.5% for each tail. Assessment of classifier performance was performed consistently for each analysis, using AUCs computed across the entire multimodal cohort by merging classifier scores obtained in the validation folds of tenfold cross-validation. Model outputs were calibrated to an optimal threshold using the Youden index and rescaled to a unit variance. The 95% CIs on these AUCs were calculated using DeLong’s methods for computing the covariance of unadjusted AUCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Violins were smoothed using the default Gaussian kernel density estimation in seaborn v.0.11.1. Significance of the AUCs were obtained against the hypothesis of meaningless class labels using perturbation testing with 20 iterations with the covariance error and s.e.m. propagated in quadrature.</p>
