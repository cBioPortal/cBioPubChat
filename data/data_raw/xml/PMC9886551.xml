          <p id="Par1">The AURORA US Metastasis Project was established with the goal to identify molecular features associated with metastasis. We assayed 55 females with metastatic breast cancer (51 primary cancers and 102 metastases) by RNA sequencing, tumor/germline DNA exome and low-pass whole-genome sequencing and global DNA methylation microarrays. Expression subtype changes were observed in ~30% of samples and were coincident with DNA clonality shifts, especially involving HER2. Downregulation of estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated cell–cell adhesion genes through DNA methylation mechanisms was observed in metastases. Microenvironment differences varied according to tumor subtype; the ER<sup>+</sup>/luminal subtype had lower fibroblast and endothelial content, while triple-negative breast cancer/basal metastases showed a decrease in B and T cells. In 17% of metastases, DNA hypermethylation and/or focal deletions were identified near <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> and were associated with reduced expression and lower immune cell infiltrates, especially in brain and liver metastases. These findings could have implications for treating individuals with metastatic breast cancer with immune- and HER2-targeting therapies.</p>

        <p id="Par3">A great deal of effort has gone into understanding the molecular causes of metastatic breast cancer (MBC), to which ~45,000 individuals per year succumb in the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. An early focus on metastatic disease has been to identify somatic DNA-based alterations that might be unique to this setting and/or that may be clinically actionable, especially when metastasis surgical resection may not be a viable option. Numerous seminal publications on MBC genomics have shown that almost no recurrent mutations are unique to the metastatic landscape, with perhaps the exception of <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic> mutations, most of which are thought to be tied to endocrine therapy resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Instead, modestly increased frequencies of known pathogenic somatic variants (that is, <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic>) and/or altered mutational signatures have been identified in metastases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, as have similarly modest increases in the frequency of DNA amplifications/deletions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Thus, much of the aggressive behavior of metastatic disease remains unexplained by DNA-based changes, invoking the need for a multiomic evaluation of this disease setting. Among the most impactful therapeutic advances in MBC has been the development and use of CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, novel HER2-directed agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting CTLA4, PD-1 or PD-L1 (refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>). These latter therapies target the immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment, thus highlighting the importance of non-tumor-intrinsic factors as a major determinant of disease outcomes. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I downregulation could also be a barrier to effective T cell-based immunotherapy. Alterations in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules can prevent tumor cells from being recognized by cytotoxic lymphocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In BC, ICIs have gained a role in both the early-stage and metastatic settings, albeit with some mixed results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, thus highlighting the need for an improved understanding of the MBC-intrinsic and MBC-extrinsic landscapes. Here, we present results from the AURORA US retrospective metastatic project that, along with the AURORA EU project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, represent two of the most ambitious programs to improve our molecular knowledge of MBCs.</p>

          <title>Clinical features of the cohort and global genomic patterns</title>
          <p id="Par4">A consortium of academic medical centers in the United States was formed (AURORA US Metastatic Project) based on the infrastructure of the Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium to pursue a multiplatform genomic study of matched metastatic and primary BCs, similar to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) effort on primary BCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Eligibility criteria for this retrospective study included the availability of a fresh-frozen (FF) metastatic specimen, its associated primary tumor (FF or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples), a source of normal DNA and corresponding tumor pathology and molecular analyte metrics (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). These requirements identified 55 individuals, including 19 individuals with more than one metastasis analyzed; 20 participant samples were collected at autopsy (representing the individuals with more than one metastasis). The clinical demographics of this group constituted a young cohort with a median age at primary diagnosis of 49 years, of which 18% were African American and 7% were of Hispanic ethnicity. In the metastatic setting, these individuals received a median of three lines of systemic therapy. As might be expected, the overall survival of these individuals was generally poor and differed according to clinical subtype (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref>). The median overall survival from BC diagnosis was 4.5 years and from metastatic diagnosis was ~2 years. Compared to TCGA primary tumors, the AURORA cohort also had a higher frequency of triple-negative BC (TNBC) and basal-like primary tumors (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">1c,d</xref>). The risk of recurrence score-based genomic features and the proliferation score itself were higher in metastatic samples than in AURORA and TCGA primary tumors (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">1e–g</xref>). Metastases were obtained from multiple sites, with the most common being liver (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 28), lung (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 13), lymph nodes (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 12), brain (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 11) and 16 other sites; the relationships between clinical or genomic subtype and site of metastasis are shown in Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Additional clinical demographics are shown in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Study design and global genomic patterns of metastatic breast tumors.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Cohort description of the AURORA Metastatic Project. <bold>b</bold>, Diagram of the shared or individual tumor DNA methylation, WGS/whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNAseq data successfully performed on each of the 55 participants; DNAme, DNA methylation; prim, primary; met, metastasis. <bold>c</bold>, Global profiling of the DNA methylation landscape using the top 5,000 most variable cancer-associated hypermethylated CpGs in 97 paired and 34 unpaired primary and metastatic tumors.

          <p id="Par5">Tumor DNA and RNA were isolated from each specimen and used in four different assays: DNA exome and low-pass whole-genome sequencing (WGS; tumor and normal), whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNAseq) using rRNA depletion and DNA methylation microarrays. In total, 88 of 153 specimens had all four assays successfully performed, and 141 of 153 had three of four completed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>); this multiplatform genomic dataset of 102 metastases and 51 paired primary tumors thus represents an unprecedented resource for the study of MBC. Global profiling of the DNA methylation landscape using the top 5,000 most variably methylated CpGs displaying cancer-associated hypermethylation showed a remarkable conservation of overall methylation profiles within most primary tumor–metastasis pairs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>); indeed, 32 of 36 tumor–metastasis pairs showed the highest correlation to each other. Similar to the DNA methylation findings, gene expression-based hierarchical clustering using a 1,710-gene breast tumor ‘intrinsic’ list<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> also identified the individuality of each primary tumor–metastasis pair, where 31 of 39 pairs were coclustered in the dendrogram (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), as seen in other studies of metastases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. To quantify the degree of similarity between pairs, we compared the average correlation between random pairs and matched pairs (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">3a–d</xref>). These comparisons revealed that overall, primary tumors are more similar to paired metastatic samples than to other breast tumors. Lastly, the somatic mutation landscape identified <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KMT2C</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">FLG</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> as the most frequently mutated genes, together with the presence of <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic> mutations in metastases from four individuals with estrogen receptor-positive (ER<sup>+</sup>) BC AF94, AER2, AD9I and AD9E (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Similarly, most somatic mutations within bona fide BC driver genes (defined in TCGA) found in AURORA primary tumors were also present in the paired metastasis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">FLG</italic> genes were more frequently mutated in metastases than in primary tumors (66% versus 33% (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.006) and 28% versus 3% (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.003), respectively); however, this finding did not reach statistical significance after false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment. For the somatic DNA copy number landscape, we calculated 533 recurrent DNA segment-level scores (<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">8</xref>) and observed that 11 segments were found to be more frequently amplified in metastases (<italic toggle="yes">q</italic> &lt; 0.05). Of these 11 segments, all overlapped an amplified region found in Bertucci et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, and 2 overlapped amplified regions found in Aftimos et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> related to <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MDM4</italic> amplifications.</p>

          <title>Gene expression subtype switching and genomic signature differences</title>
          <p id="Par6">To evaluate gene expression differences between primary tumors and their metastases, we performed PAM50 molecular subtyping from RNAseq data for each of the 123 specimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and tested subtype concordance within each individual (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>). Of the 39 RNAseq cases tested, 13 of 39 showed subtype ‘switching’ between a primary tumor and its metastasis. We note that the normal-like distinction typically reflects low tumor cellularity (tumor cellularity and ESTIMATES scores are in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>); therefore, if we disregard switching to or from the normal-like group, then the basal-like phenotype is the most stable, with 15 of 16 pairs being basal-like in all specimens. Conversely, the ‘luminal’ phenotypes that include Luminal A (LumA), Luminal B (LumB) and HER2 enriched (HER2E), experienced subtype switching in 8 of 19 individuals. We also performed TNBC subtyping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> on the TNBC samples (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and, interestingly, we observed a decreased frequency of the immunomodulatory (IM) subtype, from 13% in the primary tumor to 2% in the metastatic setting (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Subtype switching and supervised analysis of gene expression signatures between primary and metastatic tumors.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Overall molecular intrinsic subtype change between 39 participant-matched primary breast and 1 or more metastatic tumors. <bold>b</bold>, Participant-specific molecular subtype changes in 39 participant-matched primary breast and 1 or more metastatic tumors. <bold>c</bold>,<bold>d</bold>, Heat maps of some representative signatures that are significantly different between primary and metastatic tumors in luminal/HER2E (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 16 primary versus 29 metastatic tumors; <bold>c</bold>) and basal-like only subtypes (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 10 primary versus 14 metastatic tumors; <bold>d</bold>). Significance of the differences between primary tumors and metastases were calculated using LMMs (<italic toggle="yes">q</italic> &lt; 0.01). Significant signatures are row ordered from high to low according to <italic toggle="yes">ꞵ</italic>-coefficients (or regression coefficients) and divided according to upregulated (positive) or downregulated (negative) in metastasis. Individuals are column ordered according to PAM50 molecular subtype and divided according to primary tumor and metastasis. Signature scores were calculated in the level 4 RNAseq data (<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). Normal-like tumors and post-treatment primaries were removed from the analysis in the AURORA cohort.

          <p id="Par7">We next performed additional RNAseq-based statistical analyses specifically comparing primary tumors to various groupings of the metastases. We first transformed the gene expression data into a set of 749 previously published gene expression signatures representing many features of tumor cells and their microenvironment, including &gt;100 signatures of immune cells, which showed significant correlation with pathologist-assessed percent immune cell infiltration and with DNA methylation-based assessments of leukocyte infiltration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">4a–d</xref>); the complete list of signatures is shown in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>. Throughout our analyses, we relied on multiple validated immune cell signatures, including many that have shown prognostic and predictive value<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, as our main measures of immune cell presence/involvement. These immune signatures include many focused on adaptive immunity and include CIBERSORT signatures of T cells and B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and signatures of cooperating immune cells, including an IgG signature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, a B cell/T cell cooperativity signature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and a GP2-immune-metagene signature (<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). We performed supervised analyses of all primary tumors versus all metastases using this library of signatures and identified 135 signatures as being differentially expressed (<italic toggle="yes">q</italic> &lt; 0.05; Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>), including signatures of fibroblasts/stromal cells and endothelial cells and many adaptive immunity signatures as being lower in metastases. However, when supervised analyses were performed within a gene expression subtype, which is known to associate with the likelihood of metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, then subtype-specific differences were observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c,d</xref>). Specifically, luminal/ER<sup>+</sup> subtype metastases (LumA, LumB and HER2E combined) showed low expression of fibroblast and endothelial signatures, and very few adaptive immune features were different. Conversely, basal-like/TNBC metastases had significantly lower expression of adaptive immune features, including multiple T cell-, B cell-, natural killer (NK) cell- and HLA-related signatures, while signatures of fibroblasts and endothelial cells were unchanged (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par8">We next asked if there were expression signature differences according to site of metastasis, and here we focused on the three most frequent sites (that is, liver, lung and brain). Using only the AURORA dataset, testing of primary versus paired brain metastases yielded 48 signatures as being lower in brain metastases, most of which were features of immunity and fibroblasts/stromal cells (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Supervised analysis of liver metastases versus their primary tumors yielded 22 signatures as differentially expressed (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>), while a similar analysis of lung metastases yielded no significant signatures. The small number of differentially expressed features suggested that we may be limited by our sample size; therefore, we obtained a second dataset of primary tumor–metastasis pairs from our University of North Carolina (UNC) Rapid Autopsy Program (RAP; 2 primary tumor–metastasis pairs, 10 primary tumor–multiple metastasis pairs and 22 unpaired metastases represented by 82 specimens) and a third dataset from the public domain that had 102 primary tumor–metastasis pairs from the GEICAM/2009-03 ConvertHER (GEICAM) trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Using this RNAseq combined cohort to compare primary tumors and liver metastases (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 58 tumors, 27 primary tumors and 31 metastases) yielded a larger set of significant signatures that included many adaptive immunity signatures as being lower in liver metastasis (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). In addition, the combined cohort allowed us to refine our analysis of brain metastases in the setting of the basal-like/TNBC phenotype (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 13 tumors, 5 primary tumors and 8 metastases), which also yielded more significant signatures, including upregulated cell differentiation-related signatures and lower immune and stromal-related signatures (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Lastly, the combined analysis of primary lung metastases (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 36 tumors, 18 primary tumors and 17 metastases) still yielded no significant signatures.</p>
          <p id="Par9">These comparative analyses suggest that immune features may systematically vary according to site of metastasis. To directly address this hypothesis, we took advantage of the combined AURORA–RAP datasets that contain 14 participants with at least two metastases analyzed by RNAseq (one of which is from the liver) to examine immune signature levels in different metastatic sites within the same individual. This analysis showed that in 9 of 14 individuals, the lowest levels of the GP2-immune-metagene signature were in liver metastases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,b</xref>), and in many of these individuals, this immune signature is lower in the liver metastases than in the matched primary tumor but is often higher in lung metastases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,b</xref>). Next, we performed statistical testing using the combined AURORA–RAP–GEICAM cohort and comparing liver to lung metastases and liver to lymph node metastases, both of which demonstrated significantly decreased immune signatures in liver metastases (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). We also compared liver metastases and brain metastases and saw 76 differential signatures that were primarily non-immune related (except for higher γδ T cells in brain metastases). When brain metastases were compared to lung or lymph node metastases, brain metastases also demonstrated lower expression of immune-associated signatures.<fig id="Fig3" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Individuals with multiple metastases were examined for immune features in the AURORA–RAP combined cohort.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Gene expression signature scores of GP2-immune-metagene are shown according to individual specimens from participants with at least two metastases analyzed by RNAseq data (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 14 individuals).

          <p id="Par10">Finally, to evaluate the gene expression signatures as a predictive variable in survival analysis, we performed Cox proportional hazard models from time of BC diagnosis to death (overall survival) in the AURORA cohort. The major determinant of survival in this cohort was, as might be expected, a luminal/ER<sup>+</sup>-related (better outcomes) signature versus a basal-like related phenotype signature (worse outcomes). When adjusting for clinical or molecular subtype, the main survival findings were immune-related signatures that predicted better outcomes (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p>

          <p id="Par11">The decreased expression of an <italic toggle="yes">HLA</italic> metagene signature in basal-like/TNBC metastases led us to examine the multiplatform data of the individual genes comprising this signature, including <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">HLA-B</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">HLA-C</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B2M</italic>. Examining promoter CpG islands for <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">HLA-B</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">HLA-C</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B2M</italic>, we identified <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> methylation in 23 tumors (12 individuals), and <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> promoter methylation was significantly more frequent in metastases than in primary tumors when comparing unpaired data (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.035), whereas paired analyses were not significant but trending in the same direction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). By contrast, only three tumors (one individual) demonstrated methylation at <italic toggle="yes">HLA-B</italic>, and only one tumor had <italic toggle="yes">HLA-C</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">B2M</italic> methylated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). To further validate these results, we quantified HLA-A protein in 62 of the metastatic samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). We found a positive correlation of HLA-A protein with <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> mRNA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>) and with <italic toggle="yes">HLA-B</italic> mRNA but not <italic toggle="yes">HLA-C</italic> mRNA (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). We also observed lower <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> mRNA expression in <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic>-methylated tumors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, left) and a near significant positive trend between HLA-A protein expression and <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> DNA methylation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, right). DNA copy number analysis also demonstrated 23 samples from eight participants with focal deletions in this region, but in only 13 samples from three participants were these focal deletions near an <italic toggle="yes">HLA</italic> gene (&lt;40 kb; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). From these 13 samples, only three tumors (two participants) had RNAseq data, and these focal deletions appeared nominally mutually exclusive from samples with <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> methylation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). Following the same threshold applied to the <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> gene, three tumors from three different individuals had a focal deletion in the <italic toggle="yes">B2M</italic> gene (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>).

          <p id="Par12">Consistent with a functional role for these events, metastatic samples with <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> methylation or focal deletion had reduced mRNA of <italic toggle="yes">HLA</italic> genes and multiple immune signatures compared to their matched primaries (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). The <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic>-, <italic toggle="yes">HLA-B</italic>- and <italic toggle="yes">HLA-C</italic>-altered samples also demonstrated a higher degree of <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic>-predicted neoantigens (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). We also analyzed the relationship between <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> mRNA expression in primary tumors and paired metastases relative to immune signatures in the RAP dataset of 12 primary tumor–metastasis pairs and identified the same relationship of low <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> mRNA and low/lower immune cell gene expression features, which again was the most frequent in basal-like/TNBC (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">7a–d</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par13">Interestingly, we noted a strong inverse association of <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic>-predicted neoantigens with <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> gene expression, as opposed to <italic toggle="yes">HLA-B</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">HLA-C</italic>, in basal-like samples from both primary tumors and metastases (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). In basal-like primary and metastatic tumors, those tumors with <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> alterations had significantly higher numbers of MHC class I-associated neoantigens, which was not driven by a higher tumor mutational burden (TMB; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>); in particular, participant AER2 showed more than 50 times higher neoantigen load in primary tumors and liver metastases than observed in other participants. In this participant, <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> was methylated in primary and metastatic tumors, and <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> mRNA and immune signatures were even lower in the liver metastasis. By contrast, luminals and HER2E primary and metastatic tumors demonstrated higher TMB and MHC class I neoantigens in cases with MHC class I genetic or epigenetic alterations than in all other cases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>). Moreover, a general decrease in <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">HLA-B</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">HLA-C</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B2M</italic> gene expression was observed in basal-like samples with <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> genetic or epigenetic alterations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>). Taken together, these results point toward a high selective pressure on MHC class I-restricted neoantigens, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated immunity and MHC class I gene expression in basal-like BC. Of note, lower expression of MHC class I genes was observed in metastatic samples procured after increased lines of metastatic therapy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4i</xref>), regardless of subtype.</p>
          <p id="Par14">We next tested the association of primary/metastasis-specific downregulation of an MHC class I metagene signature composed of a composite expression of <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">HLA-B</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">HLA-C</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">B2M</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TAP1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TAP2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">NLRC5</italic> between metastasis and matched primary tumor according to intrinsic subtype. Across the AURORA and RAP datasets, only basal-like BCs demonstrated consistent and significant downregulation of the MHC class I metagene signature in metastatic disease (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4j</xref>). This downregulation was observed for <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">HLA-B</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">HLA-C</italic> genes only in basal-like tumors (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6d,e</xref>). Changes in gene expression for <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">HLA-B</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">HLA-C</italic> genes were consistently altered within a given metastatic sample, supporting a common regulation of all three genes (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6d,e</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par15">To determine how antigen presentation via MHC class I expression and associated neoantigens may impact the tumor immune microenvironment, we performed CIBERSORTx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> deconvolution on RNAseq data in ‘relative mode’. We constructed a correlation matrix that was further analyzed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering. We observed four associated clusters of features, two of which reflected positive feature correlation patterns and two of which reflected negative feature correlation patterns (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>). The first positive cluster reflected associations of MHC class I neoantigens (specifically those with predicted binding affinity to HLA-A and HLA-C) with tumor-associated macrophages, regulatory T cells and γδ T cells. The second positive cluster showed enrichment of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, memory-activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, B cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and inflammatory macrophages in high-MHC class I-expressing tumors, consistent with a more inflamed phenotype and intact antigen processing and presentation and adaptive immunity. Consistent with our prior finding that BCs with high MHC class I neoantigens appear to downregulate MHC class I gene expression, the first negative association cluster showed that tumors with more abundant neoantigens often were associated with poor DC cell activation hallmarks (negative cluster 1) and low expression of MHC class I genes (negative cluster 2).</p>
          <p id="Par16">Given the finding of <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> loss in the metastatic setting, we also sought to determine whether this might occur in early-stage disease and how frequently by evaluating TCGA-BRCA data that contain RNAseq, DNA-sequencing and DNA methylation data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Of 761 TCGA-BRCA tumors tested, 68 showed methylation of <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic>, and 8 showed methylation of <italic toggle="yes">HLA-B</italic> (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">8a–c</xref>). Primary tumor <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> methylation was associated with lower <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> mRNA levels and lower expression of multiple adaptive immunity signatures (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">8d–f</xref>). Importantly, tumors with <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> methylation showed worse survival outcome, even in multivariate analyses adjusting for stage and PAM50 subtype (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">8g,h</xref>).</p>

          <title>Epigenetic suppression of cell adhesion in metastases</title>
          <p id="Par17">We conducted a systematic analysis of DNA methylation changes associated with metastasis to uncover additional genes affected by an epigenetic mechanism. Cellular composition has a profound impact on DNA methylation profiles; thus, different metastatic sites could produce false-positive results through contaminating stromal DNA methylation signals. We circumvented this metastatic site contamination problem by screening for loss of methylation in metastatic tumors at <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>-regulatory elements that are consistently methylated in normal tissues representing the metastatic target tissues. We selected 19,607 CpG sites in distal enhancer-like elements defined by the ENCODE project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> that are constitutively methylated in eight normal tissue types. Statistical testing analyses comparing primary tumors to metastases identified 123 CpG sites that were significantly hypomethylated in metastatic tumors compared to their matched primaries. Using 11,348 chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP–seq) datasets, we found a significant overrepresentation of 47 DNA binding sites for 21 proteins at the 123 hypomethylated CpG sites (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Proteins involved in estrogen signaling dominated binding at these hypomethylated CpGs, including those encoded by <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">FOXA1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TFAP2A</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TFAP2C</italic>, consistent with other reports of estrogen signaling in BC progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. We further investigated the distal elements bound by ESR1 and FOXA1 by performing Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of putative target genes regulated by these elements (<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). We found that genes involved in the regulation of cell adhesion are frequently represented among the target genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). However, surprisingly, we found that distal element hypomethylation is significantly associated with reduced expression of these associated genes, suggestive of negative regulation of these genes by estrogen signaling when analyzing individuals with ER<sup>+</sup> BC only (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c,d</xref>) or even when using all individuals (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">9a–d</xref>).

          <p id="Par18">We conducted a similar screen for gain of methylation at promoters by selecting CpG sites that are constitutively unmethylated in normal tissues representing the metastatic target tissues.

We focused here on three cases that showed gene expression-based subtype switching to address the question of whether this change in expression phenotype was accompanied by DNA clonality changes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a–o</xref>). Participant AER8 was diagnosed with an ER<sup>+</sup>/progesterone receptor (PR)<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>–</sup> LumA subtype primary tumor and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant endocrine therapy plus everolimus; participant AER8 was diagnosed with liver metastases after ~20 months of treatment, received an additional three lines of therapy and succumbed to disease, at which time biopsies of several metastatic lesions were obtained (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). The two assayed liver metastases were of the same clonal lineage (orange), which was distinct from the dominant clonal lineage of the primary (purple; Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b,c</xref>), a finding also supported by the DNA hypermethylation profiles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>).

          <p id="Par20">A second example of subtype switching was participant AFR3, who was diagnosed with an ER<sup>+</sup>/PR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>–</sup> LumA BC. Participant AFR3 was treated with chemotherapy then endocrine therapy and progressed with multiple metastases, of which the brain metastasis was surgically removed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>). The brain specimen showed a dramatic change to ER<sup>–</sup>/PR<sup>–</sup>/HER2<sup>+</sup>, and gene expression analysis confirmed an increase of <italic toggle="yes">HER2</italic> expression and a subtype switch to HER2E (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>), with a concomitant DNA clonality change that included the acquisition of copy amplification of the <italic toggle="yes">HER2</italic> region and an <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">HER2</italic> E668Q activating mutation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g,h</xref>). This DNA clonal change was also reflected in the DNA hypermethylation landscape (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6j</xref>) and was associated with a downregulation of <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PGR</italic> and upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> mRNA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6i</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par21">In contrast to participant AFR3 whose BC switched to the HER2E subtype, likely due to an acquired <italic toggle="yes">HER2</italic> amplification, participant AFE4 showed a reverse trend. Namely, this participant presented with an ER<sup>+</sup>/PR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>+</sup> BC (HER2E expression subtype), where it was noted that the clinical HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) result was 2+ and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) inconclusive but was HERmark assay positive. After 30 months of trastuzumab, tumor progression was documented, a lung biopsy was obtained, and the clinical receptor status was remeasured, indicating an ER<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>–</sup> status. Additional treatments were given; however, the tumor progressed, and the participant died 18 months later. At autopsy, multiple metastatic tumor specimens were obtained (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6k</xref>). Interestingly, the three metastatic specimens assayed by RNAseq showed subtype switches to LumA or LumB, DNA clonality changes and loss of <italic toggle="yes">HER2</italic> amplification (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6l,m</xref>), while <italic toggle="yes">HER2</italic> mRNA levels were slightly decreased (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6n</xref>). DNA methylation features largely agreed with the DNA clonal evolution except for right lung metastasis (M1) that presented with the lowest DNA tumor purity score (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6o</xref>). Interestingly, liver metastasis (M6) was the most clonally distinct metastasis (as it is shown by clonal evolution history and DNA methylation), showing a subtype switch to LumA and the lowest levels of <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> expression and immune-related signatures compared to the other metastases.</p>

        <p id="Par22">Established metastatic tumors are challenging to treat, and their biology is complex. Overall, when primary tumors are compared to their matched metastases, the dominant genomic patterns seen in the primary tumors tend to be maintained in the metastases; however, significant differences have been identified that may contribute to the poor prognosis associated with MBC. In performing multiplatform analyses of primary tumors versus metastases, we discovered several patterns that may explain some metastatic tumor behaviors, including events derived from epigenetic, genomic and transcriptomic evolution.</p>
        <p id="Par23">A key epigenetic mechanism identified here was DNA methylation of <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> small focal deletions, typically in basal-like/TNBC metastatic disease, leading to lower expression of <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> and associated lowered expression of immune cell features. Alterations in <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> have also been described using loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses in BCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and by simply lower mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Here, we show a lower expression of <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> in those TCGA primary cancers with DNA methylation and, when observed, was linked to lower immune cell features and a worse overall survival. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the loss of immune cell features in some metastatic tumors, which has potential therapeutic implications. One such implication is that ICIs may have little effect on these <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic>-low tumors, as these cannot be recognized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (noting these <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic>-methylated tumors tend to have high neoantigen burdens). These results also suggest a biomarker-driven therapeutic approach wherein <italic toggle="yes">HLA-A</italic> DNA-methylated tumors (that is, the biomarker) could be targeted with DNA demethylating drugs in combination with ICIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par24">Changes in the somatic genetics of metastatic breast tumors are well documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and here we extend the changes seen in metastatic tumors into the epigenetic landscape. Gene expression subtype discordance between primary and metastatic tumors has been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, and the AURORA study here identified similar findings. Namely, in one of three individuals with BC, we identified a gene expression tumor subtype switch, which was especially frequent in individuals with luminal/ER<sup>+</sup> BC. In addition to possible epigenetic changes in tumor cells, RNAseq analysis of multiple immune cell signatures showed dramatic differences simply according to site of metastasis. It is already appreciated that the brain is an immune-privileged site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, and our results confirm this finding. There is also growing evidence that the liver is similarly immune privileged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, and our results confirm low immune cell features in liver metastases. Using this unique resource, we found that in 9 of 14 individuals with multiple metastases, liver metastases had the lowest immune cell features of any synchronous site of metastasis. These comparative metastatic tissue site findings have clinical implications because the liver is a commonly biopsied site for metastatic evaluation, and our data suggest that liver metastases are more likely to have low immune cell features, which may bias assay results of immune therapy biomarker positivity.</p>
        <p id="Par25">Interestingly, we discovered through systematic screening for metastasis-associated DNA methylation changes mechanisms leading to downregulation of <italic toggle="yes">JAM3</italic> expression in metastatic tumors, namely DNA hypomethylation at a distal ESR1 binding site and DNA hypermethylation of the gene promoter. Notably, it has been reported that <italic toggle="yes">JAM2</italic> overexpression (a second JAM family member) in BC cell lines blocks invasion and migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, <italic toggle="yes">JAM3</italic> is silenced by DNA hypermethylation in colorectal cancers, and <italic toggle="yes">JAM3</italic> suppression promotes migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. In addition, a causal interaction between DNA methylation and ER-mediated repression of gene expression has been previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, and our finding that multiple genes regulating cell adhesion appearing to be negatively regulated by estrogen signaling may have functional consequences for progression to metastasis. This is consistent with prior reports of estrogen-mediated downregulation of E-cadherin in BC cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par26">Finally, our three examples of clonal evolution highlight DNA clonality shifts coincident with gene expression-based subtype changes. In participant AER8, the clonal shift and altered expression subtype did not include any new actionable mutations, which may represent the most common finding with respect to changes in DNA-based actionable mutations in the metastatic setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. In participant AFR3, an actionable variant was identified (that is, gain of <italic toggle="yes">HER2</italic>), and trastuzumab therapy was given, although the tumor progressed. Participant AFE4 highlights yet another challenge of precision medicine wherein an actionable DNA-based feature is identified and targeted (that is, <italic toggle="yes">HER2</italic> amplification), yet the tumor eventually evades the treatment by deleting the therapeutic target. Each of these participants illustrates a third clinical impact of this study, which is if medically possible, biopsy and characterize the metastatic disease as it has likely changed relative to the primary tumor.</p>
        <p id="Par27">There are limitations to this study. The first challenge was that the sample size was likely underpowered to find somatic mutation frequency differences. The second challenge was the integration of data from FF specimens with data from FFPE specimens. The third challenge was that participants received multiple adjuvant and/or metastatic treatments, and we were not able to evaluate the treatment effects (noting each participant had an average of three lines of therapy). Nonetheless, we identified many multiplatform-supported findings concerning tumor clonal evolution and immune evasion that are common in MBCs. This multiplatform genomic data resource of metastatic disease presented here is highly complementary to the TCGA resource of primary disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> and has already begun to illuminate the molecular landscape of MBC.</p>

We obtained a waiver of written informed consent for some participants for the use of their biological specimens, and in other protocols, we obtained informed consent for the research procedures. Samples from a total of 55 female participants with MBC were the final dataset of the AURORA US cohort. Of these 55 participants, 10 (18%) were of African American descent, and 4 (7%) were of Hispanic ethnicity. The median age at initial BC diagnosis was 49 years (range: 25–76). Forty-nine participants (89%) initially presented with stage I to stage III BC, of which 19 (38%) received neoadjuvant systemic therapy, and 6 (10%) presented with de novo metastatic disease. In the metastatic setting, participants received a median of three lines of systemic therapy (range: 0–20). Metastatic samples from a total of 20 participants were collected at autopsy.

To improve the batch effect between the two data types (that is, FFPE and FF), we merged a second dataset of 101 paired primary and metastatic tumors (UNC RAP cohort) comprised of 20 FFPE and 81 FF sequenced tumors. This second dataset was partially previously published in 2018 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>), but some new samples were added and sequenced for the present work, and many of the published samples were resequenced here using the rRNA depletion method (dbGAP <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002429">phs002429</ext-link>). The RAP101 samples of the present work were created with the same RNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing protocol as the AURORA samples and represent a second dataset of FFPE and FF samples that increases our sample size for adjustments of FFPE versus FF effects. The clinical information of the RAP101 dataset is found in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>.</p>
          <p id="Par33">To address this systematic effect, we merged the raw read counts for all RNAseq samples of the previously mentioned RAP101 dataset with 123 samples of the AURORA study (level 1 data). These counts were normalized using DESeq2-normalized counts (median of ratios method)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Briefly, we created a DESeq2Dataset object and generated size factors using the estimateSizeFactors() function. Next, to retrieve the normalized counts matrix, we used the counts() function and added the argument normalized=TRUE. After generating the normalized count matrix, genes with an average expression lower than 10 were filtered from the dataset. RNAseq-normalized gene counts from the 224 dataset were log<sub>2</sub> transformed (level 2 data). Next, we used the removeBatchEffect() function from the limma R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, including both batches in the formula. Last, we subtracted only the 123 samples from the AURORA study and used this normalized, log<sub>2</sub>-transformed and batch-corrected dataset for further RNAseq gene expression analysis (level 3 data).</p>

Specifically, we used statistical testing to determine normal brain, liver and lung signatures by comparing each normal tissue to normal breast tissue (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 5; Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>; dbGAP accession number for AURORA <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002622.v1.p1">phs002622.v1.p1</ext-link> and for RAP and 9830 <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002429">phs002429</ext-link>). This normal tissue dataset was also created using the same RNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing protocols. From normalized, filtered and median-centered counts, we performed linear model (LM) regression using lme4 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>) and lmerTest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> R packages given the formula, fit = lm(genes ~ normal site of metastasis/breast normal), and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. We obtained the most significant upregulated genes in each normal tissue (FDR &lt; 0.00001) by comparing each normal tissue to normal breast tissue (brain versus breast, liver versus breast and lung versus breast); we merged these three lists and identified 1,900 genes as the distinctive upregulated genes of our ‘normal tissue signature’. To build a second signature characteristic of breast primary tumors, we did a second LM analysis between the 46 primary tumors from the AURORA study and the 5 normal breast tissue samples from the above-mentioned normal tissue cohort, and we obtained 833 significant upregulated genes (FDR &lt; 0.01). Some of these genes were also present in the ‘normal tissue signature’, and thus we removed these common 449 genes from the ‘normal tissue signature’ list, considering these genes not unique to normal tissues but also important markers for primary tumors in the AURORA cohort. Finally, the remaining 1,451 genes of the ‘normal tissue signature’ (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>) were removed from the original normalized and batch-corrected gene expression data matrix of the 123 AURORA cohort samples (referred to as the normalized, log<sub>2</sub>-transformed, batch-corrected and normal-adjusted data or level 4 RNAseq data).</p>

            <p id="Par35">To better maintain methods with past intrinsic subtyping methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, for PAM50 subtype classification assignments, we normalized the RNAseq data in a different way than described immediately above that is based on within-dataset row and column standardizations. Briefly, RNAseq-normalized gene counts from 123 primary and metastatic tumors comprised of 35 FFPE and 88 FF RNA-sequenced tumor data were log<sub>2</sub> transformed, genes were filtered for those expressed in 70% of samples, and zeros were returned to the empty values. To address the FFPE versus FF effects, we again used the AURORA and RAP101 datasets as described above and made an adjustment for FFPE versus FF. Namely, using only common genes between both datasets, we merged, row median centered and column standardized FFPE and FF groups separately, where each gene was a row, and each sample was a column. Next, we subtracted only the FFPE and FF normalized batches from the AURORA study and used these values for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Youden cutoff analysis for ER, PR and HER2 status comparisons, which provide external validation that the adjustments do not adversely affect the gene expression data using tests of correlation to the external clinical standards.</p>
            <p id="Par36">For PAM50 subtype classification, we applied a HER2/ER subgroup-specific gene-centering method as described in the supplemental methods of Fernandez-Martinez et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. For applying this subgroup-specific gene-centering method, we need the IHC status for all samples assayed by RNAseq. Six percent of primary tumors and 39% of metastatic samples did not have HER2 IHC information, and 38% of metastatic samples were missing ER status. ‘Profiled Primary ER/HER2/PR’ columns of Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> were used for this analysis. We again used ROC curve and Youden cutoff values for inferring protein clinical status using <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> gene expression data from all tumors, and we assigned ER and HER2 clinical status to those samples that had missing clinical values using the mRNA surrogates.

The new RNAseq-inferred ER/PR/HER2 protein status was used for the subgroup-specific gene-centering method (inferred ER/PR/HER2 column of Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Finally, the gene expression values of the PAM50 genes using the UQN gene counts were then normalized, and the PAM50 predictor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> was applied using the provided centroids to assign subtype calls using correlation values for all primary tumors and metastases (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p>

To minimize the false-positive results due to the normal tissue contamination, we proceeded as we did in the AURORA dataset, 1,451 genes of the ‘normal tissue signature’ (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>) were removed from the data matrix of the 428 AURORA–RAP–GEICAM cohort. From this merged set that is already batch corrected and adjusted by normal tissue, we subtracted samples from the RAP cohort that were exact duplicates or coming from the same original tissue also used in the AURORA cohort; this removed 20 of the RAP101 samples. The final cohort of 82 tumors is listed in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>, sheet 5 (RAP study), column name ‘Freeze cohort_RAP’.

            <p id="Par41">Next on the three-dataset combined data matrix, we calculated the gene signature score for each module as described before, and we performed a linear mixed model (LMM) using lmerTest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> and lme4 R packages to identify significantly changed modules between metastatic and primary tumors. In the LM, we included the term ‘patient’ as random effect or confounding variable, fit = lmer(genes ~ met/prim + (1|patient), using all the primary and metastatic tumors except the primaries identified as post-treatment primaries (participants who received neoadjuvant therapy before primary tumor collection). To avoid the possible confounding factor of intrinsic molecular subtype in the subsequent analysis, we divided tumors into two datasets based on the subtype of the primary tumor from each pair: a ‘luminal set’ comprising all LumA, LumB and HER2E subtype participants and a ‘basal-like set’ containing basal-like subtype participants only; samples called normal-like in the primary or metastatic tumors or post-treatment primary tumors were removed from the analysis (column ‘Groups PAM50 Gene Expression Analysis’ from Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). To identify significantly changed modules between brain or liver and their corresponding primary tumors only, the studied sites of metastasis versus the corresponding primary pair were compared using the same lmer function. The significantly differentially expressed modules (<italic toggle="yes">q</italic> &lt; 0.05) were hierarchically clustered using the ComplexHeatmap R package.

          <p id="Par45">FFPE tissue was sectioned at 4 µm and stained with a CK/HLA-A assay developed and optimized at Vanderbilt University Medical Center using tyramine signal amplification for increased antigen sensitivity. Sections were deparaffinized. Antigen retrieval was performed with citrate buffer at pH 6. Endogen peroxidase was blocked with hydrogen peroxide, and protein block was applied. Sections were then incubated with the first primary antibody, pan-cytokeratin (pan-CK) AE1/AE3 Biocare, at 1:1,600 overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with the secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. TSA reagent was applied according to manufacturer’s recommendations. After washing, antigen retrieval and protein block steps, the second primary antibody, HLA-A C6 Santa Cruz at 1:1,300, was incubated overnight as described. Counterstaining was performed with DAPI for nuclei identification. Tonsil and placenta tissue were used as positive- and negative-control tissues.</p>
          <p id="Par46">Whole-slide images were digitally acquired using an AxioScan Z1 slide scanner (Carl Zeiss) at ×20 magnification. Automated quantification was performed via a pathologist-supervised machine learning algorithm using QuPath software. Cell segmentation was determined on DAPI. Object classifiers were trained on annotated training regions from control tissue and tumor samples to define cellular phenotypes. Tumor cells were defined by pan-CK expression and subcellular characteristics. Once the algorithm was performing at a satisfactory level, it was used for batch analysis. For cases with low, heterogenous or null CK expression in which the classifier performance was not optimal, tumor areas were manually annotated. Out-of-focus areas, tissue folds, necrosis, normal breast and in situ carcinoma were excluded from the analysis. Single-cell data were exported from QuPath, and mean HLA-A intensity on tumor cells was further calculated in R.</p>

The EPIC platform analyzes the DNA methylation status of up to 863,904 CpG loci and 2,932 non-CpG cytosines, spanning gene-associated CpGs and a large number of enhancer/regulatory CpGs in intergenic regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Briefly, DNA was quantified by Qubit fluorimetry (Life Technologies), and 500 ng of DNA from each sample was bisulfite converted using the Zymo EZ DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research) following the manufacturer’s protocol using the specified modifications for the Illumina Infinium methylation assay. After conversion, all bisulfite reactions were cleaned using the Zymo-Spin binding columns and eluted in Tris buffer. Following elution, bisulfate-converted DNA was processed through the EPIC array protocol. For FFPE samples, the entire bisulfate-converted eluate was used as input for the Infinium HD FFPE DNA Restore kit and processed through the separate restoration workflow. To perform the assay, converted DNA was denatured with NaOH, amplified and hybridized to the EPIC bead chip. An extension reaction was performed using fluorophore-labeled nucleotides per the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>

For each batch, library construction used the NEBNext UltraII FS DNA library prep kit (New England Biolabs) with a 15-min enzymatic fragmentation. Each library received a unique dual-indexed adapter (Integrated DNA Technologies), allowing for both low-pass WGS and multiplex hybrid capture enrichment. Libraries were pooled at 2–4 µl based on final library quality and yield. To evaluate library representation due to variable DNA quality, we performed a survey of WGS sequencing for proper library balancing.
