        <abstract>
          <p id="P1">Tumor molecular profiling is a fundamental component of precision oncology, enabling the identification of genomic alterations in genes and pathways that can be targeted therapeutically. The existence of recurrent targetable alterations across distinct histologically-defined tumor types, coupled with an expanding portfolio of molecularly-targeted therapies, demands flexible and comprehensive approaches to profile clinically significant genes across the full spectrum of cancers. We established a large-scale, prospective clinical sequencing initiative utilizing a comprehensive assay, MSK-IMPACT, through which we have compiled matched tumor and normal sequence data from a unique cohort of more than 10,000 patients with advanced cancer and available pathological and clinical annotations. Using these data, we identified clinically relevant somatic mutations, novel non-coding alterations, and mutational signatures that were shared among common and rare tumor types. Patients were enrolled on genomically matched clinical trials at a rate of 11%. To enable discovery of novel biomarkers and deeper investigation into rare alterations and tumor types, all results are publicly accessible.</p>

      <p id="P2">Over the last decade, oncology has served as a paragon for the application of clinical genomics to the diagnosis and treatment of disease.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In certain tumor types, such as lung cancer and melanoma, it has become standard practice to profile tumors for recurrent targetable mutations.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Moreover, genomically-guided clinical trials have begun to evaluate the efficacy of approved and investigational molecularly-targeted therapies across distinct tumor types with shared genetic features.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
      <p id="P3">While molecular pathology has historically relied upon low-throughput approaches to interrogate a single allele in a single sample, massively parallel “next generation” sequencing (NGS) has enabled a dramatic expansion in the content and throughput of diagnostic testing. Clinical laboratories are increasingly developing and deploying NGS tests, ranging from targeted “hotspot” panels to comprehensive genome-scale platforms.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, the complexity of clinical NGS testing has prevented many laboratories from achieving sufficiently large-scale implementation to maximize the benefits of tumor genomic profiling for large populations of patients. Further, the nature of genomic alterations observed in patients with advanced metastatic cancer, who are most likely to benefit from mutational profiling, may differ substantially from what has been characterized in primary untreated cancers through research initiatives including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Finally, the true clinical utility of mutation profiling remains uncertain, requiring careful evaluation of the degree to which molecular results are influencing therapeutic decisions in different clinical contexts.</p>
      <p id="P4">At Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, we developed and implemented MSK-IMPACT, a hybridization capture-based NGS panel capable of detecting all protein-coding mutations, copy number alterations (CNAs), and selected promoter mutations and structural rearrangements in 341 (and more recently, 410) cancer-associated genes.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Since establishing MSK-IMPACT in our CLIA-compliant Molecular Diagnostics Service laboratory, we have prospectively sequenced tumors from more than 10,000 cancer patients, spanning a vast array of solid tumor types. A key feature of our process is the use of patient-matched normal controls, enabling us to compile a comprehensive catalog of definitively somatic (i.e., tumor-specific) mutations for every tumor sequenced. Through these efforts, we have produced an unparalleled dataset of matched tumor and normal DNA sequence from advanced cancer patients with associated pathological and clinical data.</p>
      <p id="P5">Here we demonstrate the feasibility and utility of large-scale prospective clinical sequencing of matched tumor-normal pairs to guide clinical management. Using our dataset of 10,945 tumors, we explored the genomic landscape of metastatic cancer as encountered in clinical practice and performed an analysis of clinical utility through the prevalence of actionable mutations and the ability to match patients to molecularly targeted therapy. To facilitate biomarker discovery, development of molecularly based clinical trials, and integration with other genomic profiling efforts, we have made the full dataset publicly available through the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cbioportal.org/msk-impact">http://cbioportal.org/msk-impact</ext-link>).<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>

        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <sec id="S2">
          <title>Description of the Sequencing Cohort</title>
          <p id="P6">Between January 2014 and May 2016, we obtained 12,670 tumors from 11,369 patients for prospective MSK-IMPACT sequencing (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). DNA isolated from tumor tissue and, in 98% of cases, matched normal peripheral blood was subjected to hybridization capture and deep-coverage NGS to detect somatic mutations, small insertions and deletions, CNAs and chromosomal rearrangements, all of which were manually reviewed and reported to patients and physicians in the electronic medical record (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We achieved an average throughput of 563 cases per month over the last 12 months of this study, with a median turnaround time of &lt;21 days (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P7">Given the diversity of cases and specimen types submitted, including archival material obtained from outside hospitals, samples exhibited a range of tissue and DNA quality metrics (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Tissues with insufficient tumor content (n=328; 3%) or DNA yield (n=793; 6%) were reported as inadequate, and we excluded samples that did not meet strict post-sequencing quality control criteria (n=604; 5%) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). DNA input and sample age influenced sequencing performance (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). For technical failures, we attempted to sequence a replacement sample, achieving a rescue rate of 75% when additional specimens were available. Altogether, we successfully sequenced 10,945 tumor samples from 10,336 patients (91%).</p>
          <p id="P8">Our cohort of successfully sequenced tumors encompasses 62 principal tumor types and &gt;300 detailed tumor types, representative of the diversity of metastatic solid cancer patients treated at our institution (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). 43% of all specimens were obtained from metastatic sites, most commonly liver, lymph node, and bone (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Two panels were used throughout this study, encompassing 341 genes (2,809 tumors, 26%) and 410 genes (8,136 tumors, 74%), with all 341 genes included in the latter expanded panel (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Tumors were sequenced to deep coverage (mean=718X) to ensure high sensitivity for detecting genomic alterations in heterogeneous and low purity specimens (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Altogether, we detected 78,066 non-synonymous mutations, with a median variant allele fraction of 0.21 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>), as well as 22,989 CNAs and 1,875 rearrangements. The number of mutations and CNAs per sample tended to be inversely proportional (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
          <p id="P9">The breadth and depth of MSK-IMPACT, and the analysis of patient-matched normal DNA, allowed us to detect important genomic alterations that would have been missed by other approaches (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). 81% (n=63,184) of all mutations fell outside the combined target regions of commercially available amplicon-based “hotspot” panels, which are also unsuited for detecting most CNAs and rearrangements.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Moreover, compared to whole exome sequencing (WES) where coverage depth is typically limited, downsampling our data revealed that at least 9% of all mutations would have been missed by WES to a mean target depth of 150X, including therapeutically targetable alterations in <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">MET</italic>. Further, while WES is capable of detecting many more mutations throughout the genome and is better suited to the characterization of certain mutation signatures, MSK-IMPACT produces more uniform coverage across the most clinically relevant genes and can also detect targetable gene fusions due to the inclusion of breakpoint-containing introns absent from current WES methods. Finally, as 69% of somatic mutations detected by MSK-IMPACT were not previously reported in the COSMIC database (v78)<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, these mutations would have been difficult to distinguish from rare inherited variants in the absence of a patient-matched normal. In summary, our results represent a rich, comprehensive and unique genomic dataset of patients with metastatic cancer.</p>

          <title>Landscape of Somatically Altered Genes</title>
          <p id="P10">To compare how our results derived from patients with advanced or metastatic cancer who were often pretreated compared to untreated primary tumors characterized by TCGA, we considered TCGA results from 16 common tumor types.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Overall, the MSK-IMPACT results were highly consistent with TCGA, exhibiting strong concordance in the identities and population frequencies of the mutations detected (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). However, we observed important differences between both cohorts, indicative of the distinct clinical features of the patients studied. To identify mutations associated with metastasis and/or treatment, we calculated the enrichment of mutations in each gene and tumor type in the MSK-IMPACT cohort compared to the TCGA cohort. We found that many genes originally identified as significant in TCGA studies were even more frequently mutated in the MSK-IMPACT cohort. Principal among these was <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, which was significantly enriched in four tumor types (prostate cancer, kidney chromophobe, glioblastoma, and gastric cancer) as compared to TCGA. In prostate cancer alone, the frequency of <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations was &gt;4-fold greater in MSK-IMPACT than TCGA (29% versus 7%), consistent with previously-noted associations between <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> status and more clinically aggressive disease.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> We also observed frequent mutations in genes that were not significant in TCGA, including <italic toggle="yes">AR</italic> (androgen receptor) in prostate cancer (18% versus 1%) and <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic> (estrogen receptor) in breast cancer (11% versus 4%), consistent with their known role in promoting resistance to hormone therapy. The most common <italic toggle="yes">AR</italic> mutations in our cohort were L702H and H875Y (10 patients each), both of which have been described as acquired mutations conferring resistance to androgen receptor inhibitors.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>
<italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic> mutations were observed at recurrent hotspots in both breast and endometrial cancers, almost exclusively in metastatic tumors arising after hormone treatment (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p>
          <p id="P11">The most frequently altered gene in the MSK-IMPACT cohort was <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> (41% of samples; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations occurred most often in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (98%), esophageal adenocarcinoma (89%), and small cell lung cancer (85%) and were largely inactivating through truncation or disruption to splicing. Altogether <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> was altered in &gt;10% of cases for 43/62 principal tumor types. <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> was the second most frequently altered gene (15% of samples). <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> mutations were most prevalent in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (90%) and colon adenocarcinoma (44%). <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> also harbored the most frequently altered codon among tumors sequenced (G12), accounting for 80% of all <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> mutations and 12% of all patients. The next most commonly mutated codons were <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> H1047, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> E545, and <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> V600 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>), each observed in more than 20 principal tumor types, indicative of positive selection across lineages.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Tumor-type differences in the location of mutations within genes were observed. For example, in <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>, mutations in glioma were localized to the extracellular N-terminal domain, while mutations in lung cancer arose mainly in the kinase domain (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P12">Genomic rearrangements, many of which produced putative gene fusions, were reported in 1,597 patients (15%).

Additional alterations, including cryptic rearrangements involving <italic toggle="yes">TMPRSS2</italic> detected in 23 prostate cancers, were suggestive of gene fusions produced by complex processes such as chromoplexy not easily discerned by targeted sequencing.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p>
          <p id="P13">While some genes were mutated at similar rates across many tumor types (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>), others were highly enriched in only one or two cancer lineages (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">VHL</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">APC</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic>).

Nevertheless, excluding hypermutated tumors, 97% of the genes in our 410-gene panel were mutated at least once in five or more principal tumor types, reinforcing the potential benefit of broad mutation profiling regardless of lineage.</p>

          <p id="P14">In addition to the coding regions of the aforementioned cancer genes, MSK-IMPACT also captures the promoter of <italic toggle="yes">TERT</italic>. Mutations at two highly recurrent hotspots in the <italic toggle="yes">TERT</italic> promoter have been shown to create novel consensus binding sites for ETS family transcription factors, leading to upregulated telomerase expression and decreased cell death.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Yet these hotspots are absent from most genomic studies because the <italic toggle="yes">TERT</italic> promoter is typically not covered by WES analysis. The MSK-IMPACT results thus provide by far the largest analysis of somatic mutations in the <italic toggle="yes">TERT</italic> promoter across all tumor types reported to date. Consistent with prior reports, G-to-A substitutions at positions −124 or −146 relative to the <italic toggle="yes">TERT</italic> transcription start site were the most common alterations (96.3%), and were observed in 43 principal tumor types (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> However, we observed 10 additional sites of recurrent <italic toggle="yes">TERT</italic> promoter mutation, including position −138, which alone was mutated in 21 distinct patients and created a presumptive ETS binding site (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).

          <p id="P15">Of all gene fusions identified by MSK-IMPACT, 35% (n=268) involved kinase genes and encompassed all or part of the kinase domain (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). While certain kinase fusions were enriched in particular lineages (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">ALK</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">ROS1</italic> fusions in lung adenocarcinoma), others occurred widely across cancers (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> We also detected many known recurrent gene fusions in tumor types where they had not previously been reported. For example, gene fusions involving <italic toggle="yes">ALK</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">ROS1</italic>, for which effective targeted therapies exist in lung cancer, were found in 11 additional tumor types. Further, we identified 51 kinase fusions involving novel partner genes. In most cases, these fusions occurred in tumors lacking other clear driver mutations, supporting a bona fide functional role and underscoring the importance of methods capable of detecting multiple partner genes to ensure that all therapeutically actionable fusions are detected.</p>
          <p id="P16">Among all kinases, <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> fusions occurred in the greatest number of tumor types. Altogether we detected 33 <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> fusions across 11 principal tumor types involving 18 distinct partner genes (10 novel), including a novel recurrent fusion gene, <italic toggle="yes">CDK5RAP2-BRAF</italic>, detected in two independent melanomas lacking other clear driver mutations (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). All fusions involved the complete kinase domain and were predicted to be in-frame. We also confirmed 4 additional fusions transcripts associated with complex <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> rearrangements using an independent RNA-based fusion assay (see Methods). These results, together with another set of 55 <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> fusions recently identified from a parallel clinical sequencing effort<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, indicate that the full spectrum of <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> fusions in human cancers remains incomplete and highlight the need to continue to broadly profile fusions in solid tumors, especially given recent reports of clinical activity with MEK inhibitors in patients harboring <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> fusions.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p>
          <p id="P17">Additionally, seven cases harbored intragenic multi-exon deletions in <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). All seven deletions were predicted to produce in-frame transcripts similar (and in some cases equivalent) to aberrant splicing isoforms previously reported in <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> V600E mutant melanomas in the setting of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> By eliminating the RAS-binding domain, these splicing isoforms enable RAS-independent BRAF dimerization and MAPK pathway activation. While this is a recurrent mechanism of acquired resistance to RAF inhibition, to our knowledge no underlying genomic basis has previously been described. Interestingly, only 3/7 cases with intragenic deletions detected by MSK-IMPACT harbored <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> V600E mutations and had received prior BRAF inhibitor therapy (one lung adenocarcinoma, one colorectal adenocarcinoma, and one melanoma). The other 4 cases received no BRAF-directed therapy, suggesting that this alteration can also arise de novo as an independent driver of tumor initiation and progression. Patients harboring these <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> deletions, either acquired or de novo, may potentially benefit from novel drugs that inhibit RAF dimerization.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p>

          <title>Mutation Signatures and Somatic Hypermutation</title>
          <p id="P18">Beyond individual somatic mutations, the presence of mutation signatures may inform the etiology of a patient’s disease and predict the likelihood of response to new therapies including immune checkpoint inhibitors. To determine whether mutation signatures could be inferred from targeted capture data, we first calculated the distribution of mutation rates for each cancer type (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Comparisons to matched WES data from 106 tumors in this cohort revealed high correlation (R<sup>2</sup>=0.76; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>), confirming that MSK-IMPACT results were representative of genome-wide processes and thus potentially capable of revealing signatures associated with biological processes that produce high mutation rates.</p>
          <p id="P19">Using the pattern and nucleotide context of all observed silent and non-silent substitutions in 994 cases (9%) with elevated mutation rates (&gt;13.8 mut/Mb, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>), we assigned the mutations in each sample to constituent mutation signatures from the set of 30 signatures described previously.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Using this approach, we identified tumors with intrinsic defects in DNA repair (e.g., DNA polymerase ε (<italic toggle="yes">POLE</italic>) associated hypermutation, mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency), exposure to exogenous mutagens (e.g., ultraviolet radiation, cigarette smoke), and exposure to prior therapy (e.g., temozolomide) in representative tumor types (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). As expected, signatures associated with ultraviolet radiation, temozolomide, and cigarette smoke predominated in melanoma, glioma, and lung cancer, respectively (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). POLE and MMR signatures predominated in colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer and were associated with underlying loss-of-function somatic mutations. Furthermore, the MMR samples also had an overall increased indel-to-substitution ratio compared to tumors with POLE or other signatures (median 0.46 versus 0.06, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.001), and 89% of samples had evidence of microsatellite instability (MSI) according to an orthogonal bioinformatics approach, MSIsensor.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p>
          <p id="P20">Altogether we identified 102 patients across 11 tumor types harboring both a dominant MMR signature and MSI classification by MSIsensor (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>), 45% of whom were not previously tested for MMR deficiency. Notably, this analysis may underestimate the prevalence of the MSI phenotype in our cohort as it is restricted to the patients with the highest mutation burden. As MSI status is increasingly being used as a biomarker for response to immune checkpoint inhibitors and an enrollment criterion for immuno-oncology basket clinical trials<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>, our results suggest that comprehensive genomic profiling may significantly expand the number of patients who could potentially benefit from immunotherapy. Among MSI patients in our cohort, responses to immunotherapy (i.e., radiographic stable disease or regression) were observed in colorectal, endometrial, gastric, prostate, and bladder cancer. In one case of a 55-year-old patient with prostate cancer, where conventional MSI testing is rarely performed, MSK-IMPACT revealed an unanticipated MMR signature without a clear underlying somatic or germline pathway lesion. As a result, the patient was enrolled on a clinical trial of an anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy regimen and has exhibited a marked response (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>).</p>

          <title>Clinical Actionability and Utility</title>
          <p id="P21">Encouraged by such anecdotes, we attempted to broadly and systematically evaluate the clinical utility of prospective molecular profiling to guide treatment decisions. We used OncoKB, a curated knowledge base of the oncogenic effects and treatment implications of somatic mutations, to group all mutations into tiers of clinical actionability (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://oncokb.org">http://oncokb.org</ext-link>)<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Mutations were classified in a tumor type-specific manner according to the level of evidence that the mutation is a predictive biomarker of drug response. Altogether, 36.7% of patients (n=3,792) harbored at least one actionable alteration (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). The tumor types with the highest proportion of actionable mutations were gastrointestinal stromal tumor (76%), thyroid cancer (60%), breast cancer (57%), and melanoma (56%) (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). While mutations in additional oncogenes such as KRAS have been considered actionable in other analyses<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and may soon become targetable by treatment modalities under investigation<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>, we utilized stricter criteria acknowledging current limited ability to therapeutically intervene in KRAS mutations with drugs currently in the clinic.</p>
          <p id="P22">We expected that only a subset of patients with potentially actionable alterations would receive genomically matched therapy due to medical and logistical considerations. To begin to evaluate the clinical utility of MSK-IMPACT testing, we first examined the rate of enrollment on genomically-matched clinical trials based on tumor genotype. Acknowledging that not enough time has elapsed to assess how many patients may eventually receive targeted therapy during their full treatment course, we considered 5,009 patients tested by MSK-IMPACT at least one year prior to this analysis. 527 (11%) patients were enrolled on at least one of 197 trials involving molecularly targeted agents at our institution, based on a target aberration in their tumor. While the most common targets belonged to the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, patients were matched to trials on the basis of alterations in &gt;50 separate genes (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P23">We next considered additional cases where standard therapy was administered on the basis of genotypes revealed by MSK-IMPACT. As an example, <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> V600 mutations were detected in 77 patients with melanoma, where they are FDA-approved biomarkers. Among these patients, 41/77 (53%) were treated with BRAF inhibitors as a single agent or in combination, with the remaining patients largely receiving first-line immunotherapy. Moreover, <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> V600 mutations were detected in 211 patients with non-melanoma histologies, of which 75/211 (36%) received BRAF targeted therapy on- or off-trial. While the proportion of non-melanoma patients receiving BRAF inhibitors was smaller, the rate of clinical benefit assessed by radiographic measurement among non-melanoma and melanoma patients was identical (71%), reaffirming the potential efficacy of targeted therapies in diverse clinical contexts and the importance of broad molecular profiling across tumor types.</p>

        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p id="P24">We report the overall experience of a large institution-wide, prospective clinical sequencing effort to guide the selection of genomically matched therapies for patients spanning all solid tumor malignancies. We demonstrate that enterprise-scale sequencing of tumors and patient-matched blood samples using a comprehensive cancer panel is feasible and achievable within a turnaround time that permits clinical interpretation and utilization. Through this initiative, we have generated an expansive dataset of manually reviewed mutations, CNAs, and genomic rearrangements in 10,945 tumors from 10,336 patients. Unlike most large-scale genome characterization efforts, our cohort was composed almost exclusively of patients with advanced disease, frequently heavily treated, and representative of the population most likely to be considered for molecularly targeted therapies. Further, our cohort encompasses &gt;300 detailed tumor types, providing an improved understanding of the prevalence of driver alterations across all cancers and allowing for the detection of uncommon and unanticipated clinically actionable mutations. With maturing clinical annotation of treatment response and disease-specific outcome, this dataset will prove a transformative resource for identifying novel biomarkers to inform prognosis and predict response and resistance to therapy.</p>
        <p id="P25">Given the diversity of tumor types that can harbor potentially actionable mutations, broad molecular profiling is necessary to provide all patients the opportunity to receive a genomically matched therapy. Novel, flexible clinical trial designs are needed to test the efficacy of molecularly targeted therapies in different cancer types. So called “basket trials”, in which patients are enrolled on the basis of a specific genetic alteration irrespective of histology, have emerged as an efficient way to evaluate the degree to which responses are determined by disease context.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> To facilitate patient identification and enrollment for genomically-guided clinical trials at our institution, we have established a process whereby all MSK-IMPACT results are transmitted to an institutional database for integration with other clinical and pharmacological data, and clinicians are automatically alerted in real-time to the presence of patients with selected mutations pertinent to their studies.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup></p>
        <p id="P26">While our results provide novel insights into the biological processes that govern cancer progression and metastasis, the true value of prospective clinical sequencing is measured according to its ability to influence treatment decisions and improve outcomes for patients. We observed that 37% of patients harbored a clinically relevant alteration, and 11% of the first 5,009 patients to receive MSK-IMPACT testing were subsequently enrolled on a genomically matched clinical trial. This gap reflects systemic shortcomings in the availability and geographical accessibility of relevant trials as well as patient preferences. Additionally, many patients may have been too debilitated to qualify for a clinical trial and, conversely, others who may later receive from targeted therapy continued to benefit from conventional treatment protocols. Nevertheless, our results are encouraging in light of prior studies reporting lower rates of enrollment on clinical trials following NGS-based tumor profiling.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Further, these results do not account for several hundred additional patients who received FDA-approved targeted therapies outside of clinical trials. We expect that the clinical utility of broad, prospective clinical sequencing will continue to increase with the proliferation of molecularly driven clinical trials, the approval of novel targeted therapies, and reductions in turnaround time of testing.</p>
        <p id="P27">Further enriching the clinical utility of our approach is the inclusion of patient-matched normal DNA for every tumor that is profiled. By sequencing DNA from both tumor and normal blood, we were able to unambiguously call somatic mutations with greater sensitivity and specificity through the elimination of rare germline variants.<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> This allowed us to accurately determine the overall mutation burden for each patient and detect distinct mutation signatures in highly mutated tumors, thereby identifying patients who stood to benefit from immunotherapy. Moreover, direct analysis of the normal DNA can reveal pathogenic germline alleles, which may mediate response to therapy in patients (e.g., PARP inhibition in patients with DNA repair defects) and suggest cancer susceptibility in their family members.<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> We have thus established an IRB-approved process for prospective germline analysis whereby inherited pathogenic variants detected by MSK-IMPACT are reported to patients who wish to receive this information.</p>
        <p id="P28">While this study represents a first step towards evaluating the clinical impact of large-scale prospective tumor sequencing, more systematic studies are needed to assess the long-term effects of clinical cancer genomics on patient outcomes. These studies will require detailed, longitudinal follow-up. Additionally, data sharing across laboratories and institutions engaged in tumor sequencing is paramount in order to realize the full discovery potential of the resulting datasets. To this end, we have deposited our full dataset into the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. It is our hope and expectation that this and other data-sharing efforts will enable the identification of promising drug targets and the development and extension of more effective treatment options to benefit more patients suffering from cancer.</p>

          <title>MSK-IMPACT sequencing workflow</title>
          <p id="P31">MSK-IMPACT is a custom hybridization-capture based assay encompassing all genes that are druggable by approved therapies or are targets of experimental therapies being investigated in clinical trials at MSKCC, as well as frequently mutated genes in human cancer (somatic and germline). MSK-IMPACT is capable of detecting sequence mutations, small insertions and deletions, copy number alterations, and select structural rearrangements, and has been validated and approved for clinical use by the New York State Department of Health Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program. Two different MSK-IMPACT panels containing 341 genes and, more recently, 410 genes were used in this study. Synthetic DNA probes were designed to capture all protein-coding exons of target genes, the promoter of <italic toggle="yes">TERT</italic>, and selected introns of 17 recurrently rearranged genes.</p>
          <p id="P32">All samples received for MSK-IMPACT testing were accessioned by the CLIA-compliant Molecular Diagnostics Service laboratory where they were assigned a unique molecular accession number, a detailed description of the specimen submitted, and the number of submitted unstained sections. Tumor and patient-matched normal blood samples were matched for simultaneous sequencing using a patient-unique medical record number (MRN). Once accessioned, a hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained slide was reviewed by a molecular pathology fellow and annotated for relevant specimen information including tumor type, tumor purity, and whether macrodissection of the indicated tumor region was necessary prior to nucleic extraction.</p>
          <p id="P33">Genomic DNA extraction was performed on the Chemagic STAR instrument (Hamilton) from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors and patient-matched normal blood using the chemagen magnetic bead technology (PerkinElmer). FFPE tissues were deparaffinized using mineral oil followed by digestion with the proteinase K enzyme, and blood samples were lysed followed by digestion with a protease enzyme to catalyze the breakdown of detrimental proteins. DNA was isolated utilizing the chemagen extraction chemistry, allowing for the high affinity binding of nucleic acids to M-PVA magnetic beads and subsequent elution. Extracted DNA samples were then transferred to the clinical next-generation sequencing laboratory for further quality control, library preparation and sequencing.</p>
          <p id="P34">DNA samples were normalized to yield 50–250 ng input and diluted in 55 μl on the Biomek FX<sup>P</sup> Laboratory Automation Workstation (Beckman Coulter), prior to shearing on the Covaris instrument. Sequence libraries were prepared on the Biomek FX<sup>P</sup> through a series of enzymatic steps including shearing, end-repair, A-base addition, ligation of barcoded sequence adaptors, and low-cycle PCR amplification (Kapa Biosystems). Tumors and matched normal were combined in pools of 24–36 libraries for multiplexed captures using custom-designed biotinylated probes (Nimblegen). Captured DNA fragments were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 as paired-end 100-base pair reads. Tumor samples were sequenced to a mean unique depth of coverage of 718X.</p>

Out of 11,549 cases that qualified for sequencing, 604 failed one of multiple quality control metrics, including average unique sequence coverage (&lt;50X) and evidence of sample contamination. Samples with no detectable alterations (including silent mutations) were also excluded if the estimated tumor purity was &lt;20% or the average unique sequence coverage was &lt;200X due to the risk of false negatives.

To match the stringency of our MSK-IMPACT variant calling filters, we required a minimum total coverage of 20X unique reads, a minimum mutant allele coverage of 8X unique reads, and a minimum variant allele fraction of 0.05.</p>

          <p id="P40">MSK-IMPACT results were compared to TCGA studies for the corresponding tumor sub-types. Coding mutations and indels excluding silent mutations were considered. Mutations in individual patient samples were aggregated to obtain gene-level alteration frequencies for each of the genes in the MSK-IMPACT panel. Chi-squared tests were performed to compare gene-level alteration frequencies between MSK-IMPACT and TCGA results. Correction for multiple hypothesis testing was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Genes that fell below an adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05, and were altered in greater than 1% and 5 individual patients in either cohort, were reported as significant. Residual sum of square (RSS) values were calculated for individual tumor types (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>).</p>

          <p id="P45">Libraries for 106 tumor samples were re-captured using the Agilent Exome Kit (v3) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 to an average coverage of 240X. Sequencing reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19) using BWA MEM followed by post-processing using the Picard MarkDuplicates tool and GATK. Variants were identified using MuTect and GATK HaplotypeCaller.

Candidate mutations were filtered for various criteria including recurrence in historical normals, total and allele-level coverage, and known systematic artifacts. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was calculated using the total number of non-synonymous mutations divided by the total genomic target region captured with the exome assay. Similarly, TMB from MSK-IMPACT was calculated by dividing the number of sequence mutations reported by MSK-IMPACT assay by the total genomic area where mutations were reported, according to the version of the assay that was used.</p>

          <title>Mutational signatures</title>
          <p id="P46">The overall TMB distribution was used to identify a threshold for considering highly mutated tumors suitable for the identification of mutational signatures, using the following formula: median(TMB) + 2*IQR(TMB), where IQR is interquartile range. Samples with a mutation burden greater than 13.8 non-synonymous mutations/Mb were analyzed.</p>
          <p id="P47">Contributions of different mutation signatures were identified for each sample according to the distribution of the 6 substitution classes (C&gt;A, C&gt;G, C&gt;T, T&gt;A, T&gt;C, T&gt;G) and the bases immediately 5′ and 3′ of the mutated base, producing 96 possible mutation subtypes. These mutations were resampled 1000 times and then subjected to decomposition analysis in which the KL-divergence is minimized between the sample signature and the approximation built up from previously described 30 signatures<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> such that each signature is assigned a weight that corresponds to the percentage of mutations explained by each given signature. A sample was determined to have a dominant signature if &gt;40% of observed mutations were attributable to that signature.</p>
          <p id="P48">For the analyses in the manuscript, we focused on 8 main signatures: Aging (Signature 1); APOBEC (Signatures 2 and 13); Smoking (Signature 4), BRCA1/2 (Signature 3); MMR (Signatures 6, 15, 20 and 26); UV (Signature 7); POLE (Signature 10) and TMZ (Signature 11). For each sample, we identified somatic mutations in POLE and mutations in MMR pathway genes, automatically retrieved smoking status from our institutional database, and calculated the ratio of indels-to-SNVs. We also analyzed each sample using the MSIsensor algorithm, which identifies the percentage of microsatellite loci that are unstable in the tumor genome compared to its matched normal.</p>

          <title>Clinical assessment and matching to clinical trials</title>
          <p id="P49">To assess clinical actionability of mutations detected by MSK-IMPACT, we annotated sequence mutations, copy number alterations, and rearrangements according to OncoKB, a curated knowledge base of the oncogenic effects and treatment implications of somatic mutations (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://oncokb.org">http://oncokb.org</ext-link>)<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Mutations were classified in a tumor type-specific manner according to the level of evidence that the mutation is a predictive biomarker of drug response. Briefly, mutations were classified according to whether they are FDA-recognized biomarkers (Level 1), predict response to standard-of-care therapies (Level 2), or predict response to investigational agents in clinical trials (Level 3). Levels 2 and 3 were subdivided according to whether the evidence exists for the pertinent tumor type (2A, 3A) or a different tumor type (2B, 3B). Tumor samples were annotated according to the highest level of evidence for any mutation identified by MSK-IMPACT.</p>
          <p id="P50">To determine the rate of enrollment to genomically matched clinical trials, we obtained a list of 850 clinical trials open at MSKCC on which any patient tested by MSK-IMPACT was ever enrolled up to September 2016. After reviewing the enrollment criteria and mechanism of action of each therapy, 197/850 clinical trials were deemed to have a target aberration. A patient was considered to be “matched” if he/she harbored at least one alteration considered to be a target for at least one clinical trial on which they were enrolled. Only patients whose tumors were sequenced during the first 18 months of the MSK-IMPACT sequencing initiative (prior to July 2015) were considered, given that utilization of molecular profiling results and changes to treatment regimens may not occur for many months (or longer) after testing. Of 5,009 patients tested by MSK-IMPACT prior to July 2015, 1,894 (38%) were enrolled on any clinical trial, 811 (16%) were enrolled on a clinical trial with a targeted agent, and 527 (11%) harbored genomic alterations matching the drug target. 72% of all matches occurred after the MSK-IMPACT reports were issued, with the remaining matches based on the results of prior molecular testing.</p>
          <p id="P51">Clinical responses for patients receiving immunotherapy and targeted BRAF-directed therapy were assessed by detailed chart review. Response was defined as radiographic stable disease or tumor regression at or near 3 months from the initiation of therapy.</p>

          <p>Overview of MSK-IMPACT clinical workflow. Patients provide informed consent for paired tumor-normal sequence analysis, and a blood sample is collected as a source of normal DNA. DNA is extracted from tumor and blood samples using automated protocols, and sequence libraries are prepared and captured using hybridization probes targeting all coding exons of 410 genes and select introns of recurrently rearranged genes. Following sequencing, paired reads are analyzed through a custom bioinformatics pipeline that detects multiple classes of genomic rearrangements. Results are loaded into an in-house developed genomic variants database, MPath, upon which they are manually reviewed for quality and accuracy. Genomic alterations are reported in the electronic medical record, transmitted to an institutional database (Darwin) that facilitates automated clinical trial matching, and automatically uploaded to the cBioPortal for data mining and interpretation.</p>

(<bold>a</bold>) Alterations were annotated based on their clinical actionability according to OncoKB, and samples were assigned the level of the most significant alteration. Briefly, levels of evidence varied according to whether mutations are FDA-recognized biomarkers (Level 1), predict response to standard-of-care therapies (Level 2), or predict for response to investigational agents in clinical trials (Level 3). Levels 2 and 3 were subdivided according to whether the evidence existed for the pertinent tumor type (2A, 3A) or a different tumor type (2B, 3B).
