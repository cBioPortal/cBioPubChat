        <abstract>
          <p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has a dismal prognosis and insights into both disease etiology and targeted intervention are needed. A total of 109 micro-dissected PDA cases were subjected to whole-exome sequencing. Microdissection enriches tumour cellularity and enhances mutation calling. Here we show that environmental stress and alterations in DNA repair genes associate with distinct mutation spectra. Copy number alterations target multiple tumour suppressive/oncogenic loci; however, amplification of <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> is uniquely associated with poor outcome and adenosquamous subtype. We identify multiple novel mutated genes in PDA, with select genes harbouring prognostic significance. <italic toggle="yes">RBM10</italic> mutations associate with longer survival in spite of histological features of aggressive disease. <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> mutations are observed in &gt;90% of cases, but codon Q61 alleles are selectively associated with improved survival. Oncogenic <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> mutations are mutually exclusive with <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> and define sensitivity to vemurafenib in PDA models. High-frequency alterations in Wnt signalling, chromatin remodelling, Hedgehog signalling, DNA repair and cell cycle processes are observed. Together, these data delineate new genetic diversity of PDA and provide insights into prognostic determinants and therapeutic targets.</p>

      <p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) portends a poor prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of â¼6% (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). This poor outcome is related to multiple factors, including the relatively late stage of diagnosis, many patients presenting with unresectable disease, and therapy recalcitrance resulting in disease recurrence in spite of operable disease and systemic therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Genetic analysis of PDA yielded insights related to altered signalling pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>; however, unlike other cancers the number of sequenced PDA genomes has been relatively modest. This reflects the difficulty of sequencing a tumour that is dominated by presence of stromal and inflammatory cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Tumour cellularity in samples subjected to whole-exome or -genome sequencing represents a known barrier in obtaining high quality data; therefore, many studies recommended &gt;60% tumour cell content in the samples<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. To facilitate mutation detection and remove contaminating non-neoplastic tissue the initial PDA sequencing effort employed patient-derived xenografts and cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. This approach resulted in detecting an average of 48 somatic mutations per model sequenced. Subsequent work employed exome sequencing on 99 clinical cases of PDA, and applied the q-pure algorithm to overcome contamination with non-neoplastic tissue, yielding an average of 26 mutations per case<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here 109 micro-dissected PDA cases annotated with outcome data were subjected to whole-exome sequencing. The data from this analyses demonstrates that there is substantial genetic diversity within PDA with a mutation frequency comparable to other solid tumours. Alterations in mutation spectra and burden are associated with hallmark pancreatic cancer risk factors. Increased copy number variation indicative of chromosomal instability is associated with poor outcome. Amplification of the locus involving the <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> oncogene are specifically associated with poor outcome and association with adenosquamous subtype of PDA. In contrast, select mutated genes (for example, <italic toggle="yes">RBM10</italic>) are associated with longer patient survival. Diversity within the canonical KRAS signalling pathway defined prognostic features of the disease and the potential for targeted therapy of BRAF-mutated cases. The mutation and copy number alterations frequently involved important signalling pathways that contribute to tumour development and represent therapeutic targets.</p>

          <p>To enhance tumour cellularity in PDA patient samples, needle dissection was employed to significantly enrich PDA tumour cells from the surrounding microenvironment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). This approach was applied to a total of 109 surgically resected PDA cases annotated with clinical outcome and etiological features (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The cohort had a median survival of 21 months that is consistent with historical survival of resected PDA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Of standard pathological features, grade 3 was associated with poor outcome, while nodal status and adenosquamous subtype trended towards poor outcome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 1 and 2</xref>). Enriched tumour cells were utilized as the substrate for whole-exome sequencing (Methods). Average tumour purity exceeded 50% and the average sequencing depth was â¼50 Ã . In prior studies sequencing PDA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, 26 mutations were detected per case representing a relatively low mutational burden when compared with the majority of solid tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 3 and 4</xref>). The average mutation burden observed in our cohort was 67 non-synonymous events per case, equivalent to multiple other solid-tumour types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 3â5</xref>). Sanger sequencing was used to validate 248 genetic events with validation occurring in 92% of cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). In addition, p53 immunohistochemistry performed across the cohort demonstrated the expected strong correlation between <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutation and stabilization of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). To determine whether deeper sequencing would further increase the number of mutations detected, 21 cases were sequenced to â¼120 Ã depth. The majority of events identified with deeper sequencing had low allelic frequency or coverage depth, and only a small fraction of statistically significant mutations were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref> and Methods).</p>

By hierarchical clustering it was apparent that the variable mutational spectra of individual PDA cases specified discrete subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>).

Remarkably, <italic toggle="yes">RBM10</italic> mutations were associated with enhanced survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), although all <italic toggle="yes">RBM10-</italic>mutated cases were of high grade, pT3 stage and harboured lymph node metastasis in three of four cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 21</xref>). Mutations in the chromatin remodelling gene ARID1A trended towards poor survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Immunohistochemical analyses of additional 296 PDA cases demonstrated that ARID1A protein deficiency was significantly associated with poor outcome in this expanded cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The loss of ARID1A protein is similarly observed in multiple PDA cell lines, although whether this event is functionally significant is unknown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 22</xref>). Loss of ARID1A is known to induce vulnerability to ARID1B depletion in other cancer models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and we could confirm this finding in ARID1A-deficient PDA cell lines, indicating that loss of protein has a functional consequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 22</xref>). To further explore gene interactions, deterministic clustering was performed followed by analysis of exemplar cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 23</xref>).

          <title>Genetic diversity in the KRAS pathway</title>
          <p>PDA is dominated by mutations in <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> that were detected in 92% of the cases in our cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The majority of KRAS mutations occurred in codon 12, although mutations also occurred in codons 13 and 61 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b and c</xref>), consistent with other sequencing studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). It has been suggested that different <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> mutations harbour diverse biological activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Notably, while all mutations affecting codon 12 exhibited similar association with survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 25</xref>), cases mutated at codon 61 had a remarkably favourable prognosis in this cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Interestingly, as we observed in the <italic toggle="yes">RBM10</italic> mutant tumours, cases harbouring mutations at codon 61 paradoxically exhibited histological and clinical features indicative of poor survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 26</xref>). When assessed for pERK staining, cases with <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> mutations at codon 61 exhibited less ERK activation as compared with cases with other <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). This finding suggests that in PDA, <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> mutant allele status potentially determines the quality of RAS pathway activation and the prognosis of disease.</p>
          <p>While prior sequencing studies have shown that a small subset of PDA cases harbour wild-type <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic>, the genomic driver(s) of these tumours has remained obscure. Here we found that <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> wild-type PDA exhibit somatic lesions in known oncogenes that are also RAS effector proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 27â30</xref>). Importantly, the <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations and <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> mutations, occurring in cases with wild-type KRAS, are known to be mechanistically activating and are enriched in other tumour types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 27â30</xref>). In cases with wild-type <italic toggle="yes">KRAS, BRAF</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> a number of cancer-associated genes representing potential drivers were identified (for example, <italic toggle="yes">STK11, GNAS, CHEK2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 28</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> V600E mutations, occurring at a frequency of 3%, were mutually exclusive with <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 29</xref>). While the expression of <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> V600E would suggest that it is a driver event based on mouse models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, no endogenous model of this form of pancreatic cancer had been developed.

          <title>Frequently mutated pathways in pancreatic cancer</title>
          <p>In addition to heterogeneity within the core KRAS pathway, we detected multiple additional pathways that were genetically altered at high frequency (&gt;20%) in PDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 31â33</xref>). Specifically, we found that the TGF-Ã pathway is disrupted via a combination of largely mutually exclusive events in addition to the frequent disruption of <italic toggle="yes">SMAD4</italic>. This includes loss of <italic toggle="yes">TGFBR2/TGFBR1</italic>, as well as mutations in <italic toggle="yes">ACVR1B</italic>, which is a newly identified cancer-associated gene in the pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Similarly, in concert with frequent deletion of <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2B, CDK4</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic> amplification and <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> loss was observed in the RB pathway. Among signalling pathways, beta-catenin and NOTCH pathways exhibited frequent alterations indicative of oncogenic activation. Multiple Fanconi Anaemia genes as well as <italic toggle="yes">ATM, CHEK2, BCLAF1, BRCA1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> were observed to be mutated or deleted at relatively high frequency with alterations targeting some facet of DNA repair occurring in &gt;35% of cases. Genetic lesions in chromatin remodelling SWI/SNF pathway occurred in 42% of the cases. In addition to these well-described pathways, we observed frequent aberrations that impinge on histone modification and the FAT/HIPPO pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 31â32</xref>). Each pathway was interrogated for association with outcome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 34</xref>). Only DNA repair-associated pathways had a trend towards poor outcome, while beta-catenin signalling trended towards improved outcome. In general, the associations between pathways were limited as determined by Pearson's correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Random Forest and APC clustering were used to define subtypes of PDA based on altered pathways, and demonstrated marked diversity of combinations of deregulated pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 35</xref>). While tumours with isolated KRAS-pathway alterations alone or in combination with TP53 have a poor prognosis, tumours with more complex pathway deregulations trended towards even poorer outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Many of the highlighted pathways represent therapeutic targets that are actionable in preclinical models and, in some cases, in the clinic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). For example, BRAF V600E has been shown to be a potential target in melanoma and other cancers. Loss of <italic toggle="yes">RNF43</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">AXIN1</italic> are associated with sensitivity to porcupine and tankyrase inhibitors targeting the beta-catenin pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, while deletion of <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> or amplification of <italic toggle="yes">CDK4/CCND1</italic> confer sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Deficits in Fanconi Anaemia genes can be targeted by cross-linking agents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, a finding readily observed in cell lines harbouring homozygous deletion of <italic toggle="yes">FANCF</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 36</xref>). Similarly, loss of BRCA function is associated with response to PARP inhibitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>In total, the data herein demonstrates that PDA is a genetically diverse disease harbouring mutational burden similar to other solid malignancies. Due to the enrichment approach utilized, we identified multiple significantly mutated genes that have not been previously described in PDA and provide genetic insights into the etiology, prognostic features and potential therapeutic targets.</p>
        <p>Risk factors for PDA, include smoking and deficits in DNA mismatch repair as exemplified by Lynch Syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. We observed that smoking status in PDA was associated with a mutation spectra similar to other smoking-associated tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. We also found that select cases exhibit a âmutator' phenotype, suggesting a contribution of mismatch repair deficiency in tumorigenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p>
        <p>In the analysis of copy number, we identified many regions that have been previously identified by CGH and other methods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In general, tumors with more copy number alterations (indicative of chromosomal instability) exhibited mutations in DNA break repair genes and trended toward poor prognosis. Importantly, we discovered that <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> amplification was associated with poor prognosis and adenosquamous histology. We did not identify mutations in <italic toggle="yes">UPF1,</italic> which has been recently reported to be selectively mutated with high frequency in pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. In spite of a comprehensive unbiased survey of amplicons/deleted regions only one locus (MYC) was associated with outcome; however, clearly there is variation in the overall magnitude of copy number alterations, suggesting that there are perhaps distinct drivers for the chromosomal instability observed in PDA.</p>
        <p>Using MutSigCV and pathway analysis, multiple genes and pathways altered at high frequency were identified, a subset of which associated with survival. <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic> was confirmed as a marker of poorer outcome using an independent cohort, and <italic toggle="yes">RBM10</italic> mutation was associated with longer survival. We also uncovered a number of novel <italic toggle="yes">albeit</italic> rare alterations in signalling pathways important in PDA biology. While <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> loss is common in PDA and contributes to the aberrant cell cycle progression, loss of <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic> amplification has not been previously reported. In PDA tumours harbouring wild-type KRAS, we identified <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations at oncogenic hotspots expanding the spectrum of oncogenic drivers in PDA. Importantly, a cell line developed from BRAF V600E-mutated PDA was equally sensitive as melanoma cells to FDA-approved BRAF inhibitor PLX-4032. In addition to these rare, potentially, clinically actionable events, several pathways that were genetically altered at high frequency (&gt;20%) in our study could yield selective therapeutic sensitivities. Genetic lesions targeting some facet of DNA repair or chromatin remodelling SWI/SNF pathway occurred in &gt;35% and 42% of PDA cases, respectively. Alteration in WNT/beta-catenin pathway were common and included loss of RNF43 or AXIN1 conferring sensitivity to porcupine and tankyrase inhibitors targeting. A number of these genetic alterations remain actionable in the presence of an activating KRAS mutation and could provide the opportunity for genetically targeted therapy in PDA.</p>
        <p>Together this expanded genetic framework of PDA reveals disease complexity that will contribute to future efforts of disease modelling and patient stratification for treatment.</p>

For 21 cases, the sequencing depth was doubled with an average number of 5.523 Ã 10<sup>9</sup> bases sequenced per case. The average fold coverage was 123.01 (95% CI: 115.4â130.6). Across target sequences, 94.74% (95% CI: 93.41â96.07) had &gt;15 read coverage. With the deeper sequencing relatively few additional mutation were discovered. The increased depth largely served to detect mutations with low sequence coverage and allele frequency. These data are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>.</p>

          <p>Somatic point mutations and INDELS in the tumour tissues compared with their corresponding normal tissues were identified using the MuTect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> and VarScan2 algorithms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, respectively, with default parameter settings. The mutations were annotated using Broad Institute's Oncotator programme. Minimum of 14 reads covering a site in the tumour and 8 in the normal were required for mutation calling. Only INDELS with reference allele counts greater than eight and tumour variant allele counts greater than three were considered.</p>
          <p>Genome Analysis Toolkit (v2.4, DepthOfCoverage) was used to calculate the coverage for all sequenced cases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Log ratio of coverage between tumour and normal were normalized by circular binary segmentation using ExomeCNV and DNAcopy packages in R/Bioconductor. To obtain copy number alterations in tumours compared with normal tissue, GISTIC 2.0 module version 6.2 with join segment size=4 and confidence level=0.95 was used<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. SNV and INDEL analyses were summarized into tables using R (R Core Team-2014; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org">http://www.R-project.org</ext-link>).</p>

          <p>Hierarchical clustering and KaplanâMeier analyses were performed using the stats and survival packages in R. Associations of genes with features of disease was determined using hypergeometric testing, with <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.05 considered significant. Survival between two groups was determined using log-rank statistic, with <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.05 considered significant. Heatmaps for mutation spectrum and pathway oncoprints were generated using the R package pheatmap. All other plots were generated using the graphics package in R.</p>
          <p>The MutSigCV algorithm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> was run locally with default settings to define significantly mutated genes with input MAF files developed from the merge of MuTect and VarScan outputs. To remove any gene paralogue or alignment driven artifacts, the mutations at all positions for high-frequency genes were interrogated by BLAST against the human genome. This approach removed a number of high-frequency false positives, including CDC27 and FRG1. Mutations in significantly mutated genes and all INDELs were manually interrogated by examining BAM files in Integrative Genomics Viewer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Subsequent filtering was employed were genes with at least four nonsilent mutations (&gt;3.5%) were retained. A <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value cut-off of 0.05 was used to obtain a list of top significantly mutated genes. Subsequent analysis of sequenced paralogues or analogous sequences was used to further restrict the results to 24 genes. A list of MutSigCV-defined genes to <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.1 with associated <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> values is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>. Unsupervised Random Forest clustering approach was used to cluster the pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Random Forest package in R was used to obtain the Random forest dissimilarity measure and the data was classified into clusters using the partitioning around medoids implemented in the cluster package in R.</p>
          <p>Clustering analysis was performed with the APC algorithm using the âapcluster' package in R. APC is a deterministic clustering method, which identifies the number of clusters, and cluster âexemplars' (that is, the cluster centroid or the data point that is the best representative of all the other data points within that cluster) from the data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. APC performs clustering by passing messages between the data points. It takes as input a square matrix representing pairwise similarity measures between all data points. The algorithm views each data point as a node in a network and is initialized by connecting all the nodes together where edges between nodes are proportional to Pearson correlations. The algorithm then iteratively transmits messages along the edges, pruning edges with each iteration until a set of clusters and exemplars emerges.</p>
          <p>Two real valued messages are passed between nodes. The âresponsibility' message computes how well-suited it is for point <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> to choose point <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> as an exemplar, given all the other candidate exemplars, <italic toggle="yes">kâ²</italic>, and is updated by:</p>

          </p>
          <p>The availability message, <italic toggle="yes">a</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">i</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>), computes how appropriate it is for point <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> to select point <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> as an exemplar, taking into account all the other points for which <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> is an exemplar, <italic toggle="yes">iâ²</italic>, and is given by:</p>

The entire sum is thresholded at 0, and a negative availability indicates that it is inappropriate for point <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> to chose point <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> as an exemplar and the tie is severed. The self-availability, <italic toggle="yes">a</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">k,k</italic>), reflects the accumulated evidence that point <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> is an exemplar and is updated with the following rule, which reflects the evidence that <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> is an exemplar based on the positive responsibilities sent to <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> from all points, and is updated by:</p>

            </disp-formula>
          </p>
          <p>In the first iteration, all points are considered equally likely to be candidate exemplars, and <italic toggle="yes">a</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">i, k</italic>) is set to 0 and <italic toggle="yes">s</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">i, k</italic>) is set to the input similarity measure between points <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>. The above rules are then iteratively updated until a clear, stable set of clusters and exemplars emerges.</p>
          <p>In our implementation of the algorithm, we first ran the algorithm to identify an initial set of exemplars and clusters from the data. The exemplars were then clustered together and this procedure was repeated until no more clusters emerged to identify a hierarchical structure of clusters.

          <title>Validation</title>
          <p>A total of 248 nonsilent mutations from 84 of the 109 tumour/normal tissue pairs were selected to validate by Sanger sequencing. This validation encompassed 132 different genes, including most that were referenced in the text (for example <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic>). We aimed to validate mutations with allelic frequency of &gt;0.15, recognizing that Sanger sequencing sensitivity is impaired by low mutant allele frequency. Mutations confirmation was 92% (95% CI: 87.64â94.58%). This range is consistent with other studies using MuTect to define mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, validated mutations are denoted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>.</p>

          <p>ARID1A immunohistochemistry was performed in a clinical laboratory using a BenchMark Ultra autostainer (Ventana Medical Systems). The ARID1A antibody (cat# sc-32761, Santa Cruz Biotechnologyâdilution 1:150) specificity was confirmed by negative staining in cases with known mutation in ARID1A. All scores were read blind to outcome, and data were dichotomized based on loss of the homogeneous ARID1A staining observed in normal tissue or known cases with intact ARID1A gene. Association with survival was performed by KaplanâMeier analysis. Phospho-ERK immunohistochemistry (cat#4370, Cell Signaling Technology-dilution 1:150) was performed on a DAKO autostainer. All scores were read blind to outcome or association with KRAS mutation.</p>
          <p>Tumours from the Pdx1-Cre/CAG-Î²geo-tTA/TetO-Myc transgenic mice were formalin fixed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, embedded and stained for haematoxylin and eosin.

          <p>The established PDA cell lines PL45, CAPAN2, PL5, ASPC1 and HS7662 were obtained from ATCC and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The cell line derived from PDA_014 was established from primary tumour fresh tissue that was digested with trypsin and plated on collagen coated plates in Keratinocyte Serum-Free Media supplemented with Bovine Pituitary Extract, EGF and 2% FBS. Tumour cells were expanded and subjected to sequencing analysis, which confirmed the retention of select tumour-associated mutations including BRAF V600E. The melanoma cell line MNT1 was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Sensitivity to PLX-4032 was determined by flow-cytometry, crystal violet and CTG analysis as we have previously published<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. For immunoblotting, 30âÎ¼g of total protein were resolved by SDSâPAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore).
