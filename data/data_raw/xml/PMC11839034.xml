        <abstract id="ABS1">
          <p id="P1">To better understand the homeostatic mechanisms governing melanocytes, we performed deep phenotyping of clonal expansions of single melanocytes from human skin. In total, we interrogated the mutational landscapes, gene expression profiles, and morphological features of 297 melanocytes from 31 donors. To our surprise, a population of melanocytes with low mutation burden was maintained in sun damaged skin. These melanocytes were more stem-like, smaller, less dendritic and displayed distinct gene expression profiles compared to their counterparts with high mutation burdens. We used single-cell spatial transcriptomics (10X Xenium) to reveal the spatial distribution of melanocytes inferred to have low and high mutation burdens (LowMut and HighMut cells), based on their gene expression profiles. LowMut melanocytes were found in hair follicles as well as in the interfollicular epidermis, whereas HighMut melanocytes resided almost exclusively in the interfollicular epidermis. We propose that melanocytes in the hair follicle occupy a privileged niche, protected from UV radiation, but periodically migrate out of the hair follicle to replenish the interfollicular epidermis after waves of photodamage. More broadly, our study illustrates the advantages of a cell atlas that includes mutational information, as cells can change their cellular states and positional coordinates over time, but mutations are like scars, providing a historical record of the homeostatic processes that were operative on each cell.</p>

        <p id="P2">During embryogenesis, neural crest cells give rise to smooth muscle, bone, connective tissue, neurons, and melanocytes<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Melanocytes are pigment producing cells that mostly migrate to the skin but can colonize, to a lesser extent, other sites in the body. The developmental trajectory of the melanocytic lineage has predominantly been traced in animal models<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, but there are key differences between melanocytes from humans and other animals. Fish, birds, and rodents evolved pigmentation mainly to alter their appearance (e.g. for camouflage or mating purposes)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, whereas in humans, pigmentation evolved as a defense mechanism against UV radiation<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P3">Single-cell RNA-sequencing has helped define the cellular fates of melanocytes in humans<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. As an example, melanocytes from acral body sites (the non-hair bearing skin of the foot sole, palm, and nail bed) occupy a distinct cellular state from the cutaneous melanocytes found elsewhere in the body<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, likely explaining why acral melanomas are biologically different from cutaneous melanomas<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. While RNA-sequencing has illuminated anatomic specificity within melanocytes in humans, our understanding of their cellular hierarchies remains incompletely understood.</p>
        <p id="P4">To address this gap in knowledge, we catalogued the mutational, gene expression, and morphological features of small colonies of individual melanocytes expanded <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> from human skin (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1A</xref>). Cell atlas studies are routinely carried out by performing single-cell RNA sequencing to define cellular states<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Our multi-omic approach has advantages over single-cell RNA-sequencing alone (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1B</xref>). Single-cell RNA-sequencing provides a one-dimensional view into the biological state of each cell, and the shallow sequencing depth from these technologies imparts limited resolution into heterogeneity within a cellular lineage. Our work revealed mutationally distinct subpopulations of melanocytes in the skin. Moreover, we validated their existence and interrogated their spatial distribution with spatial transcriptomics (Xenium Analyzer, 10X Genomics).</p>

          <title>Phenotyping melanocytes from human skin</title>
          <p id="P5">Melanocytes were collected from punch biopsies of sun-exposed adult skin. After incubation in dispase to break down extracellular matrix proteins, the epidermis was physically separated from the dermis with tweezers. Bulk melanocytes were established in tissue culture from the epidermal compartment as described (see <xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">methods</xref>). This separation strategy is thought to enrich for melanocytes from the interfollicular epidermis<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p id="P6">We catalogued somatic mutations in melanocytes by clonally expanding individual melanocytes into small colonies (~230 cells), further amplifying the DNA and RNA of each colony <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>, and sequencing the amplified nucleic acids (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1A</xref>). We developed a bioinformatic approach, which we previously described<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, to call mutations at high sensitivity and specificity from each expansion of melanocytes. Since we sequenced both DNA and RNA, there was matching gene expression data to accompany the mutational information from each colony. The RNA was sequenced at higher depth than a typical cell atlas study<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, providing higher resolution into lineage subtypes. Furthermore, we photographed each colony to record their morphological features.</p>
          <p id="P7">A limitation to our approach is the involvement of cell culture, which may alter the gene expression, morphological, or, to a lesser extent, the mutational state of each cell. We also characterized fewer cells than a typical cell atlas study. However, these limitations are counterbalanced by the extensive phenotypic information that was collected from each cell’s colony (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1B</xref>). In total, we profiled 297 cells from 58 independent skin biopsies of 31 unique donors – approximately half were previously published<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and the remaining are newly sequenced here.</p>

          <title>Low- and high- mutation burden melanocytes co-exist in human skin</title>
          <p id="P8">The mutation burden of individual melanocytes varied from person to person, site to site within each person, and cell to cell within each site<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. In this study, we focused on the latter source of variability, aiming to understand how melanocytes from the same skin biopsy, which would be expected to experience similar exposures to UV radiation, accumulate different levels of mutational damage.</p>
          <p id="P9">Towards this goal, we plotted the mutation burdens of individual melanocytes versus the mutation burdens of the tissues from which they were derived (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Skin samples with high mutation burdens, on average, maintained a subpopulation of melanocytes with low mutation burdens. We defined melanocytes with low- and high- mutation burdens as those in the bottom and top quartile of mutation burdens. We also restricted our comparisons to melanocytes from tissues whose mutation burden exceeded 3 mutations/Megabase (mut/Mb) – this decision was due to the fact that it was difficult to separate low- and high- mutation burden melanocytes when there was little mutational damage in the tissue. The gates defining the high- and low- mutation burden melanocytes are shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>.</p>

          <p id="P10">Next, we characterized the types of mutations in the two populations of melanocytes. The melanocytes with high mutation burdens had a greater proportion of cytosine to thymine transitions at the 3’ basepair of dipyrimidines (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) – the classic mutation associated with UV radiation<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. They also had a greater proportion of signature 7 mutations (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) – a signature defined in pan-cancer analyses that is attributable to UV radiation<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. By contrast, the low mutation burden melanocytes had a greater proportion of “clock-like” signatures 1 and 5<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). These observations imply there is a subpopulation of melanocytes in heavily sun exposed skin that remains relatively protected from UV radiation.</p>

          <title>Low- and high- mutation burden melanocytes have distinct gene expression profiles</title>
          <p id="P11">To further understand the biological differences between melanocytes with low- and high- mutation burdens, we performed differential gene expression analysis (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). As expected, both groups expressed melanocyte markers at levels that were several orders of magnitude greater than keratinocytes or fibroblasts (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, upper heatmap), confirming their shared melanocytic lineage despite phenotypic variation within the lineage. The significantly upregulated genes in melanocytes with high- and low- mutation burdens were compared to the molecular signature database<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. All gene sets with significant overlap are listed in <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>, and a subset of notable overlaps (discussed below) are highlighted in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3C</xref>.</p>
          <p id="P12">The melanocytes with high mutation burdens expressed higher levels of genes involved in pigmentation and antigen presentation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Examples include <italic toggle="yes">HMOX1, ABCC2</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">MC1R</italic>, whose proteins participate in metabolism and catabolism of pigmentation products. Melanocytes with high mutation burdens also expressed <italic toggle="yes">HERC2</italic>, which has a well-established genetic linkage to skin tone, eye color, and melanoma susceptibility in genome-wide association studies<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Finally, they expressed genes overlapping with previously described immune signatures (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), including genes whose products are responsible for protein breakdown (<italic toggle="yes">LIPA, HMOX1</italic>) and antigen presentation (<italic toggle="yes">HLA-DPA1</italic>).</p>
          <p id="P13">The melanocytes with low mutation burdens expressed higher levels of genes typically observed in cells from neuronal, smooth muscle, and connective tissues (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). This was notable because, during development, neural crest cells give rise to each of these cell types in addition to melanocytes. Examples of neural crest genes include: <italic toggle="yes">VCAN, FBN1, PALLD, ITM2A</italic> (connective tissue genes); <italic toggle="yes">TAGLN, MYL9, MYLK, SGCE, HACD1</italic> (smooth muscle genes); and <italic toggle="yes">SEMA3C, TCF4, DAAM2, RGMB, NTNG1</italic> (neuronal genes).</p>
          <p id="P14">We also compared the genes, upregulated in low- and high- mutation burden melanocytes, to gene sets defined in cell atlas studies focused on melanocytes<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). The genes upregulated in our high mutation burden melanocytes overlapped with genes upregulated in “adult” melanocytes from Belote and colleagues, and the genes upregulated in our low mutation burden melanocytes overlapped with “melanocyte stem cell (MSC)” genes from Belote and colleagues. The “MSC” gene set, from Belote <italic toggle="yes">et. al.</italic>, was enriched in melanocytes from fetal tissue and suggested to derive from melanocytes in hair follicles<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p id="P15">Finally, we used a recently developed tool, WIMMS (What Is My Melanocytic Signature), to interrogate how our gene expression signatures relate to other melanocytic signatures (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Briefly, WIMMS re-interpreted 39 commonly referenced gene expression signatures from studies of melanoma or melanocytes, showing that many of the signatures are capturing overlapping cell states. With this framework, our high mutation burden melanocytes are most similar to “Differentiated” melanocytes from other studies, while our low mutation burden melanocytes are most similar to “AXL”, “Neuronal”, and “Invasive” melanocytes from other studies.</p>
          <p id="P16">Taken together, gene expression analyses suggest that melanocytes with high mutation burdens occupy a relatively differentiated state as compared to low mutation burden melanocytes.</p>

          <title>Low- and high- mutation burden melanocytes have different morphological features</title>
          <p id="P17">Next, we compared the morphology of melanocytes with high- and low- mutation burdens (see <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>-<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">B</xref> for representative examples of each). Melanocytes that could be distinguished from their neighbors were segmented, and we calculated their perimeters, surface areas, and number of dendritic extensions. Melanocytes with high mutation burdens had more complex morphologies, defined by the ratio of their perimeter to surface area (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). They also tended to be dendritic and larger (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">E</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P18">Immunostaining for MITF and MLANA (markers for melanocytes) has shown that dendritic melanocytes are enriched in the interfollicular epidermis and the bulb of the hair follicle, while ovoid melanocytes are enriched in the hair bulge<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> – the niche for epithelial and melanocytic stem cells. Since low mutation burden melanocytes were less dendritic in tissue culture, more stem like, and less sun damaged, we hypothesized that they have spent most of their lives in the hair bulge.</p>

          <title>Spatial transcriptomics reveals the localization of melanocytes with high and low mutation burdens in human skin</title>
          <p id="P19">To test our hypothesis, we used the Xenium analyzer (10X Genomics) to interrogate the localization of melanocytes with high and low mutation burdens in human skin. The Xenium platform measures spatial expression patterns across hundreds of transcripts at subcellular resolution over a large field of view (up to 1x2cm). When choosing probes, we started with a generic skin panel, designed to mark common cell lineages in the skin, and supplemented it with custom targets, which included all genes upregulated in melanocytes with high and low mutation burdens (see <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S5</xref> for a list of all 360 genes included on the panel). We chose a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sample of normal skin from the back of a 63-year-old male who had been diagnosed with melanoma. The skin came from the non-lesional portion (i.e. the normal, adjacent skin) of a wide excision biopsy of the patient’s melanoma. The skin sample also had solar elastosis, suggesting it had experienced high levels of cumulative sun damage. In total, we measured the localization of ~96 million transcripts in ~300K cells. Cell segmentation and clustering distinguished different cell types in the skin (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4</xref>), but for the purposes of this study, we focused our analyses on melanocytes.</p>
          <p id="P20">In each melanocyte, we counted the number of transcripts mapping to genes upregulated in high versus low mutation burden cells and rank ordered cells by their relative expression of these gene sets. Melanocytes with HighMut gene expression programs were almost exclusively found in the interfollicular epidermis (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>-<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Melanocytes with LowMut gene expression programs were enriched in hair follicles but could be found in the epidermis, too (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>-<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). When melanocytes with LowMut gene expression programs were in the epidermis, they were more common near the opening of the hair shaft (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). These findings suggest that melanocytes with low mutation burdens originate in the hair follicle but can migrate to the interfollicular epidermis. We also inferred the area of each cell, and the LowMut melanocytes were relatively smaller (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), consistent with the morphological features observed <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p id="P21">In this study, we catalogued mutational, gene expression, morphological, and spatial profiles of melanocytes to infer cellular hierarchies in human skin. Among these modalities, mutational information is the least common in cell atlas studies, but it proved to be uniquely informative. Cells can change their transcriptional states and positional coordinates over time, but mutations are like scars, providing a historical record of the homeostatic processes that were operative on each cell. To our surprise, we found a population of melanocytes in sun-exposed skin with remarkably low mutation burdens, raising an important question. How can cells from the same skin biopsy, ostensibly receiving the same doses of UV radiation, accumulate such different mutation burdens?</p>
        <p id="P22">Our single-cell analyses were performed on melanocytes harvested from the interfollicular epidermis. A spatial analysis showed that the interfollicular epidermis houses melanocytes inferred to have both high and low mutation burdens, based on their gene expression patterns. These analyses also showed that the hair follicle is heavily enriched with melanocytes inferred to have low mutation burdens, based on their gene expression profiles. We presume that melanocytes with low mutation burdens spend most of their lives in the hair follicle, thus shielding them from the damaging effects of UV radiation, and they migrate to the epidermis in response to UV radiation (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The bulge houses melanocyte stem cells, and the melanocytes with low mutation burdens retain morphological and gene expression features of stem cells.</p>
        <p id="P23">In mice, exposure to UV radiation can induce melanocytes to exit the hair follicle and populate the interfollicular epidermis<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. In humans, patients with vitiligo do not have epidermal melanocytes (a consequence of auto-immunity against those cells), but treatment with UV radiation causes melanocytes in the hair follicles to migrate into the epidermis and repigment the skin<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Our work suggests that these waves of migration are not one-off events, only observed in an experimental or disease setting. Instead, they likely occur on a regular basis in physiologically normal skin, perhaps as a mechanism to replenish melanocytes after sun damage (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The possibility that these homeostatic mechanisms could be co-opted for therapeutic intent is intriguing. The mutation burden of tissues is thought to increase with age<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, but with more research, it may prove feasible to replace heavily mutated cells with fresh cells to rejuvenate tissue.</p>
        <p id="P24">In a separate study<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, Yoshida and colleagues described a population of bronchial epithelial cells with “near-normal” mutation burdens admixed with heavily damaged cells from the lungs of smokers. They postulated that the epithelial cells with low mutation burdens may have occupied a privileged niche for much of their lives. In barrier organs, such as skin and lung, more work is needed to understand the location of stem cell reservoirs and how they replenish the cells at the first line of defense. To achieve this goal, cell atlas studies will need to focus on more data modalities than gene expression. Large-scale consortiums have transcriptionally profiled over 85 million cells and counting<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. While these studies have undoubtably proven useful, our work illustrates the benefits of fewer cells but more information per cell, including mutational profiles.</p>

          <p id="P28">The skin biopsy was first trimmed to remove excess subcutaneous tissue and then incubated in 10 mg/ml dispase II for 16-18 hours at 4°C. After incubation, the epidermis was separated from the dermis. A single-cell suspension of the epidermal layer was obtained by incubating the tissue in 0.05% trypsin for 3 minutes, with intermittent vortexing every 10-15 seconds.</p>
          <p id="P29">The resulting single-cell suspension was seeded in CNT40 medium (CELLnTEC) supplemented with 5% antibiotic-antimycotic and cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 to establish a bulk culture of keratinocytes and melanocytes over the course of a week. Melanocytes were then selectively isolated through limited trypsinization for 3 minutes, which detaches only the melanocytes, leaving the keratinocytes adhered.</p>
          <p id="P30">The melanocytes were manually seeded as single cells into 96-well plates using serial dilution and cultured in melanocyte media (CNT40) to grow into clonal colonies of approximately 230 cells or more. Manual seeding was preferred over FACS, as it was less abrasive to primary cells and yielded better results. Colonies were monitored daily to ensure that only single-cell-derived melanocyte colonies were selected, and this regular screening also allowed for determining the optimal time to harvest the cells before they underwent growth arrest. Additionally, this approach enabled confirmation of cell type based on cell morphology. The ex vivo clonal expansion increased starting material such that somatic alterations could be detected with high sensitivity and specificity, as previous described<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and detailed further below.</p>

Following alignment, Picard (v4.1.2.0) (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/" ext-link-type="uri">https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>) was used to deduplicate the genomic reads. The aligned reads were then realigned around indels and recalibrated using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK v4.1.2.0)<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. In terms of the RNA samples, sequencing reads were aligned to both the genome and transcriptome using STAR align (v2.1.0)<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Deduplication of RNA reads was performed using Picard (v4.1.2.0). Read counts for each gene were quantified with RSEM (v1.2.0)<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p id="P37">To identify germline heterozygous SNPs, FreeBayes (v1.3.1)<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> was employed, and the SNPs were filtered to include only those overlapping with known SNPs in the 1000 Genomes Project<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and with allelic frequencies between 40-60%. Among other uses, this information was utilized to detect allelic dropout, assisting in the removal of samples with low coverage or amplification biases. CNVkit (v0.9.6.2) was used to infer copy number alterations from both DNA and RNA sequencing data<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Additionally, short insertions and deletions were detected using Pindel<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, with filtering to retain only indels present in the reference genome and supported by at least four reads. The remaining indels were manually inspected in IGV to remove artifacts.</p>
          <p id="P38">Somatic mutations were identified as detailed here<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Briefly, the initial candidate point mutations were called using MuTect2 (v4.1.2.0)<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Although Phi29 polymerase exhibits high fidelity, artifacts can still arise during amplification in MDA or PTA protocols. To remove these and other sequencing artifacts, a multi-step filtering process was applied. First, haplotype phasing was performed using germline heterozygous SNPs to infer haplotype information; true mutations were expected to show linkage to these nearby SNPs, while artifacts typically displayed incomplete or no linkage. Second, RNA validation was conducted by verifying the presence of somatic mutations in RNA sequencing data, as artifacts were not anticipated to be present in both genomic and transcriptomic datasets. This strategy was particularly effective for identifying mutations in highly expressed genes.</p>
          <p id="P39">Remaining mutations were further scrutinized based on their variant allele frequency (VAF).

          <p id="P41">To identify melanocyte subpopulations with high and low mutation burden, we plotted the mutation burden of individual melanocytes versus the mutation burden of the skin biopsy from which they were derived. For this analysis, the median mutation burden of all sequenced melanocytes from each biopsy was considered the biopsy’s overall mutation burden. Linear regression was performed to fit trendlines through the upper and lower quartiles of mutation burdens. Melanocytes falling into the top quartile (Q1) were classified as having a high mutation burden, while those in the bottom quartile (Q4) were classified as having a low mutation burden (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Only biopsies with a minimum mutation burden of 3 or higher were included, as it is unreliable to distinguish subpopulations from biopsies with minimal DNA damage.</p>

The skin mount consisted of normal, non-cancerous tissue located at the margin of a wide excision performed to remove melanoma, ensuring the presence of normal melanocytes with a high mutation burden. A 5 μm section of the skin was mounted on a Xenium slide, with two skin sections positioned within the sample area (10.45 mm x 22.45 mm) such that the epidermis of each section faced the other along the length of the slide. Care was taken to ensure that none of the fiducial markers were covered, and any obstructions were manually removed to expose all markers correctly.

Next, the paraffin was removed from the slides, followed by rehydration and decrosslinking of the tissue sections to release sequestered mRNA.</p>

The skin sections were then stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, dehydrated, and coverslipped for imaging. The samples were scanned at 20X magnification using the Leica Aperio CS2. The output was processed using QuPath bioimage analysis software to extract a pyramidal, tiled "OME.TIF" image file. This image was then imported into Xenium Explorer and manually aligned using a best similarity transformation method.

In the first sample, 28.2% of the cells were segmented based on boundary staining, 62.8% by RNA staining, and 9.0% by nuclear (DAPI) expansion. The second sample showed similar segmentation, with 27.5% boundary stain, 62.5% RNA stain, and 10.0% DAPI expansion. For further analysis, cells with fewer than 20 transcripts per cell, as determined by the Phred quality score, were excluded. The XOA pipeline identified 41 distinct clusters in the first skin sample based on gene expression profiles. These clusters were categorized into five groups: melanocytes, keratinocytes, immune cells, adnexal cells, fibroblasts, and an “others” category, which likely included apoptotic cells, unevenly segmented cells, or rare cell types that do not fit into the other five main categories. The reannotated clusters were visualized using a UMAP projection (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4</xref>). A total of 1,918 melanocytes were detected.</p>

Multi-cluster differential expression analysis using the DESeq2 package (v1.38.3) confirmed the defined cell types (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4</xref>). The thresholds for this analysis were an adjusted p-value (Benjamini-Hochberg) of 0.05 and a log2 fold change greater than 1. The top 10 genes enriched in each cell type cluster were visualized as a dotplot heatmap, where upregulated genes were marked in red, and the size of the dot indicated the fraction of cells expressing the gene.</p>
          <p id="P63">To identify melanocytes with high and low mutation burdens, a read count matrix for all genes in the cluster was generated. A delta count (the difference between the sum of reads for genes enriched in high mutation melanocytes and those enriched in low mutation melanocytes) was calculated for each cell, and cells were rank ordered based on their relative expression of “HighMut” versus “LowMut” genes. The top 15th percentile of cells was classified as high mutation melanocytes, and the bottom 15th percentile as low mutation melanocytes. This method relies on detecting cells with high expression of genes associated with high mutation melanocytes and low expression of genes associated with low mutation melanocytes, and vice versa. Using this approach, 287 high mutation melanocytes and 287 low mutation melanocytes were identified in the first sample, and 307 high mutation melanocytes and 307 low mutation melanocytes in the second sample.</p>
          <p id="P64">After identifying the two melanocyte subpopulations spatially, we quantified their counts in three distinct regions of the skin sample based on proximity to hair follicles: follicular, near-follicle, and interfollicular regions (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The results are presented as a bar graph with a 95% confidence interval, and significance was determined using the Poisson test. We also measured the surface area of each melanocyte in the two subpopulations. The surface area data was visualized in a box and whisker plot using Tukey’s method, with significance calculated using Tukey’s post-hoc Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test.</p>

            <p id="P67">Figure S3. The relationship between HighMut and LowMut gene expression signatures relate to other melanocytic signatures. The WIMMS (What Is My Melanocytic Signature) tool was used to determine how gene expression in high- and low- mutation burden melanocytes correlate with genes expressed in previously published melanocytic signatures. Previously published signatures are grouped broadly into stem-like and differentiated signatures with subgroups, as indicated. Our HighMut signature clustered with other differentiated signatures while our LowMut signature clustered with other stem-like signatures.</p>
            <p id="P68">Figure S4. Diverse cell types, including melanocytes, are recognized in Xenium data of normal human skin. <bold>A.</bold> A UMAP, produced by the Xenium Ranger workflow (see <xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">methods</xref>), shows the relationship of hundreds of thousands of cells from a normal skin biopsy. The graph-based clustering algorithm identified 42 clusters of cells, which were aggregated into six broader groups of cells based on their gene expression profiles. <bold>B.</bold> The localization of different cell types in Xenium data. The epidermis is mainly comprised of keratinocytes with melanocytes occasionally observed in the basal layer. Adnexal structures extend into the dermis, surrounded by a low density of fibroblasts and immune cells. <bold>C.</bold> The top 10 genes associated with each group of cells. The melanocytes were distinguished by their expression of known pigmentation genes.</p>

          <title>Melanocytes with high- and low- mutation burdens coexist in human skin biopsies.</title>
          <p id="P75">The mutation burdens (mutations/megabase, mut/Mb) of individual melanocytes are plotted versus the mutation burdens of the skin biopsies from which they were collected. The mutation burden of each skin biopsy is defined as the median mutation burden of all melanocytes from that biopsy. Upper, middle, and lower quartile trendlines are shown. Low- and high- mutation burden melanocytes were gated (see <xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">methods</xref>) as shown. Note how skin samples with high mutation burdens maintain populations of melanocytes with few mutations.</p>

Each column represents one melanocyte. The middle panel shows the fraction of UV-radiation-induced mutations in each melanocyte, and the bottom panel shows fractions of mutational signatures in each cell. The melanocytes are arranged in descending order by their fraction of UV-induced mutations (middle panel). The dot plots summarize select features in high- and low- mutation burden melanocytes, including mutation burden (<bold>B</bold>), fraction of UV-radiation-induced mutations per cell (<bold>C</bold>), fraction of SBS7-associated mutations per cell (<bold>D</bold>), as well as fraction of SBS1 and SBS5 associated mutations per cell (<bold>E</bold>). The green bars represent the mean values for each subset, while each dot corresponds to the value for an individual melanocyte. Statistical significances are based on the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (****<italic toggle="yes">p &lt; 0.0001</italic> for cell-to-cell comparisons).</p>
