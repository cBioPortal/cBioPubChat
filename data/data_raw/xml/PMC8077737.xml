          <title>SUMMARY</title>
          <p id="P3">The integration of mass spectrometry-based proteomics with next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing profiles tumors more comprehensively. Here this “proteogenomics” approach was applied to 122 treatment-naive primary breast cancers accrued to preserve post-translational modifications, including protein phosphorylation and acetylation. Proteogenomics challenged standard breast cancer diagnoses, provided detailed analysis of the <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> amplicon, defined tumor subsets that could benefit from immune checkpoint therapy, and allowed more accurate assessment of Rb status for prediction of CDK4/6 inhibitor responsiveness. Phosphoproteomics profiles uncovered novel associations between tumor suppressor loss and targetable kinases.Acetylproteome analysis highlighted acetylation on key nuclear proteins involved in the DNA damage response and revealed cross-talk between cytoplasmic and mitochondrial acetylation and metabolism. Our results underscore the potential of proteogenomics for clinical investigation of breast cancer through more accurate annotation of targetable pathways and biological features of this remarkably heterogeneous malignancy.</p>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
        <p id="P6">The heterogeneity of breast cancer (BRCA) biology deeply challenges the drive for personalized treatment (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Hyman et al., 2017</xref>). Contemporary precision therapies target defects in DNA repair, activated protein kinases, the estrogen receptor (ER), and the immune tumor microenvironment, often in combination (<xref rid="R127" ref-type="bibr">Telli et al., 2019</xref>). Effective application of these approaches depends on our ability to accurately profile tumors to identify individual therapeutic vulnerabilities, but current methods in early-stage BRCA, including mRNA-based prognostic tests, are inadequate (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Coates et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R109" ref-type="bibr">Ross et al., 2007</xref>). Although more comprehensive genomic techniques are used in the advanced disease setting, the interpretation and clinical implementation of the resulting data have proved to be challenging, with many recurrent mutations currently undruggable (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Condorelli et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, recently introduced treatments, such as CDK4/6 and immune checkpoint inhibitors, do not have robust predictive biomarkers, which can lead to missed therapeutic opportunities and overtreatment (<xref rid="R95" ref-type="bibr">O’Leary et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R117" ref-type="bibr">Shindo et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P7">Proteogenomics is an approach to tumor profiling that combines next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing with mass spectrometry-based proteomics to provide deep, unbiased quantification of proteins and post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (<xref rid="R111" ref-type="bibr">Ruggles et al., 2017</xref>). The Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) seeks to perform deep-scale proteogenomics profiling across multiple cancer types. Our initial proteogenomics analysis of BRCA using residual samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provided proof of principle that proteogenomics represented an advance in BRCA profiling (<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">Mertins et al., 2016</xref>). However, the relatively small number of TCGA samples with sufficient material for deep proteomics represented different fragments from those used for genomics, did not uniformly pass proteomics quality assessment, and were not collected using protocols designed to preserve post-translational modifications (<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Mertins et al., 2014</xref>). Here we describe proteogenomics characterization of the largest cohort to date of BRCA samples that were acquired to minimize ischemic time, maximizing fidelity and reducing pre-analytical variability. We offer the first comprehensive report of the BRCA acetylome; present testable hypotheses regarding therapeutic vulnerabilities, cancer biology, and advancement of diagnostic standards; and provide an extensive resource to stimulate further discovery.</p>

          <title>Proteogenomic (PG) Characterization of Prospectively Collected Breast Tumors</title>
          <p id="P8">We prospectively collected treatment-naive primary tumors under a stringent protocol that controlled tissue ischemia (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>) to preserve post-translational modifications. Each tumor was cryopulverized, and DNA, RNA, and protein were extracted from the resulting single homogeneous sample (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1A</xref>). Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based isobaric labeling provided precise relative quantification of proteins and phosphorylation and acetylation sites following published CPTAC protocols (<xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">Mertins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S1A</xref> and <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B</xref>). Stringent criteria for protein identification and quantification resulted in high data quality across 15 tumor TMT-plexes (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S1C</xref>–<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1E</xref>) connected by a common reference sample (<xref rid="S13" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>). Notably, all tumors passed post-data acquisition quality control (QC) metrics for proteomics analysis (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S1F</xref>–<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1H</xref>), an improvement compared with our previous study (<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">Mertins et al., 2016</xref>). Longitudinal data quality and reproducibility were demonstrated across several months of mass spectrometry data acquisition by periodic analysis of full-process replicates of a proteomics comparative reference sample (CompRef; <xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">Mertins et al., 2018</xref>) and by assessment of inter-plex common reference and replicate sample reproducibility (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S1I</xref>–<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1L</xref>). Across the dataset, appropriate filtering (<xref rid="S13" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>) yielded identification of 29,647 somatic mutations, 23,692 gene-level copy number events, 23,121 gene transcripts, 10,107 proteins, 38,968 phosphorylation sites, and 9,869 acetylation sites (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref rid="SD7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P9">The PAM50 model was applied to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to determine representation of intrinsic subtypes (<xref rid="R96" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Somatic mutation profiles and subtype/somatic mutation associations were consistent with previous reports (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</xref>). This BRCA cohort therefore represented a wide range of established genomic and transcriptomic features (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S2A</xref> and <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B</xref>). Somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) data were analyzed to detect focal and arm-level events (<xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">Mermel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S2C</xref> and <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2D</xref>) with confirmation of anticipated effects on mRNA and protein abundance (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Gillette et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">Mertins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R147" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Summaries of the results of these integrative multi-omics analytic approaches are provided (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S2E</xref>–<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2G</xref>; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>).</p>

          <title>Non-negative Matrix Factorization-Based Multi-omics Classification of BRCA</title>
          <p id="P10">To explore intrinsic cohort structure using the full complement of proteogenomics data, single-omic and multi-omics clustering were performed for SCNA, mRNA, protein, and individual phosphosite and acetylation site abundance using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) (<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Seung, 1999</xref>, <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Although NMF yielded between two and six clusters in single-omic analyses (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3A</xref>), integrative multi-omics analysis converged on four NMF clusters, with cluster membership scores indicating the strength of association of each sample with a given cluster (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S3B</xref> and <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3C</xref>; <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Clusters designated luminal A-inclusive (NMF LumA-I) and basal-inclusive (NMF Basal-I) were almost entirely composed of tumors with the corresponding PAM50 assignments. Thus, these samples represent the extremes of the BRCA intrinsic subtype classification (<xref rid="R96" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3B</xref>). The NMF LumA-I cluster was enriched for hormone (estrogen and progesterone) receptor positivity and wild-type <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> and demonstrated high stromal infiltration scores (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S3B</xref> and <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3D</xref>). The NMF Basal-I cluster contained all but one PAM50 basal sample and was strongly enriched for <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations and negative clinical hormone receptor status (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3B</xref>). Higher levels of immune, stemness, and chromosome instability (CIN) scores (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S3D</xref>–<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3G</xref>) as well as strong enrichment of proliferation-associated pathways such as E2F targets and the G2/M checkpoint were observed in NMF Basal-I tumors (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3H</xref>).</p>

The luminal B-inclusive cluster (NMF LumB-I) comprised all but one LumB case but also included a subset of PAM50 LumA samples.

Tumor metabolic characteristics were profiled at the level of the proteome, and unsupervised clustering of differentially expressed (DE) metabolism-related proteins (<xref rid="S13" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>) grouped samples into 4 clusters that closely reflected the 4 NMF clusters described in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Metabolism-driven cluster 1 almost exclusively represented NMF Basal-I tumors with upregulation of proteins involved in DNA elongation, translation, and metabolism of carbohydrates and downregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis, metabolism of amino acids, and vitamins and cofactors. Metabolism-driven clusters 2 and 3 largely coincided with NMF LumA-I and NMF LumB-I, respectively, with an inverse overall metabolic feature profile relative to NMF Basal-I. Only NMF LumA-I showed upregulated glycosaminoglycan metabolism, which may reflect the stroma-enriched features of these tumors (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3D</xref>). Metabolism-driven cluster 4, dominated by NMF HER2-I tumors, showed upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid metabolism as a HER2-I feature that is independent of <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> amplification status (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S3I</xref> and <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3J</xref>).</p>

Here, Ac levels normalized to protein abundance were used to identify NMF cluster-specific protein Ac events (<xref rid="S13" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>). Uniform upregulation of Ac for TCA cycle and β-oxidation proteins in the NMF Basal-I cluster and for glucose metabolism and interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling-related proteins in the NMF LumB-I clusters was observed in these analyses (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Ac levels were also differentially distributed across cellular compartments. Most of the DE mitochondrial Ac sites were upregulated in NMF Basal-I, whereas two thirds of DE cytoplasmic Ac sites were downregulated compared with LumB-I, implying compartment-specific regulation of Ac in the NMF Basal-I subtype (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). This suggests that major cytoplasmic and mitochondrial metabolic pathways are differentially regulated between NMF Basal-I and LumB-I subtypes. For example, for NMF Basal-I samples, the central metabolic pathway in the cytoplasm, glycolysis, was upregulated at the protein level (HK3, PFKP, GAPDH, ENO1, and LDHB) and hypoacetylated at the post-translational level (GPI, TPI1, GAPDH, PGK1, PGAM1, ENO1, PKM, and LDHA) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S5A</xref> and <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B</xref>).

As further examples of NMF Basal-I-specific metabolism, mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), TCA cycle, and β-oxidation enzyme proteins were specifically hyperacetylated (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref>; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S5A</xref> and <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B</xref>). An unbiased search for potential regulators of metabolic protein Ac revealed significant negative associations between protein levels of the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 and Ac of mitochondrial proteins (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that deregulation of SIRT3 protein expression (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5D</xref>) could broadly affect mitochondrial Ac in BRCA.

The nuclear Ac Basal-I cluster 1 (N-Ac Basal-I C1) showed significantly higher protein mean expression levels for multiple DNA repair pathways, such as the base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), double-strand break repair (DSBR), single-strand break repair (SSBR), homologous recombination (HR), and Fanconi anemia pathways than the other N-Ac Basal-I cluster (C3) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). <xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S6</xref> includes mean expression levels for unique proteins from specific repair pathways (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Anurag et al., 2018a</xref>) as well as for more inclusive SSBR and DSBR gene sets.

These differentially acetylated proteins were enriched for nucleoplasmic proteins, RNA metabolism, chromatin-modifying enzymes, and histone Ac by the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) pathway (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5F</xref>). Interestingly, elevated Ac in the activation loop of CREBBP-K1591K1592 may explain the observed hyperacetylation of nuclear proteins in N-Ac C1 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). The presence of active CREBBP was suggested by high Ac of multiple histone H2B N-terminal Ac sites (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), as observed previously (<xref rid="R139" ref-type="bibr">Weinert et al., 2018</xref>). Other lysine acetyltransferases (KAT7 and KAT6A/B) and their complex partners (JADE3, BRPF3, BRD1, ING4, and MEAF6) were also hyperacetylated in N-Ac C1, although the effect of Ac on these proteins is largely unexplored. However, the increased Ac of histone H4 at site K13 and H3.3 at site K15 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), known targets of KAT7 acetyltransferase (<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">Miotto and Struhl, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">Mishima et al., 2011</xref>), suggests higher activity in N-Ac Basal-I C1. Finally, both subunits of the Ku70/80 complex from the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway demonstrated elevated Ac of Ac sites located in the DNA-PK binding (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, XRCC5-K702) and C-terminal arm domains (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, XRCC6-K516).</p>

In addition to an unresponsive tumor lacking <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> amplification by exome sequencing and ERBB2 protein by mass spectrometry, these analyses determined that two treatment-resistant cases (of a total of 13 cases with <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> gene amplification) had “pseudo-ERBB2+” status, with low-level ERBB2 protein expression (more similar to non-amplified cases than amplified cases with pathologic complete response [pCR]) despite evidence of <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> amplification by exome sequencing (DP1 samples in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6A</xref>). Because these pseudo-ERBB2+ samples are examples where anti-ERBB2 treatment may not have been effective because of lack of drug target expression, proteogenomics approaches were used to assess ERBB2 driver status in the current dataset and our earlier cohort (<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">Mertins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S6A</xref> and <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B</xref>).

Central immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing was used to refine ERBB2 status where possible (68 tumors), and all of the ERBB2 PG+ samples were classified according to ASCO-CAP guidelines (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cap.org/">https://www.cap.org/</ext-link>) as ERBB2+ (IHC score of 3+ or IHC score of 2+ and amplified by fluorescence <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> hybridization [FISH]) or with equivocal status (IHC score of 2+ without FISH results or amplified by FISH without IHC results). Similar to the data in DP1, cases of pseudo-ERBB2 positivity were identified, with two of 17 instances of <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> gene amplification in the current cohort and one of 16 in the retrospective cohort being associated with protein expression levels that were within the distribution for ERBB2 PG− samples (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S6A</xref> and <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B</xref>). The DP1 study also identified a pseudo-ERBB2+ case with amplification and overexpression of TOP2A, suggesting an alternative chromosome 17 amplicon driver in some cases (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2009</xref>). Supporting this hypothesis, <italic toggle="yes">TOP2A</italic> amplification and protein overexpression in the absence of ERBB2 protein overexpression were observed in one pseudo-ERBB2+ case each in the present and retrospective cohorts (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6A</xref>).</p>

A stimulatory immune modulator protein signature was even more highly correlated with the IHC I-TME data (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). RNA level profiles inferred for individual acquired and innate immune cell types (including B cells; cytotoxic, helper, and regulatory T cells; natural killer (NK) cells; dendritic cells (DCs); eosinophils; and macrophages) generally tracked with CIBERSORT absolute scores in each subtype (e.g., cluster 1; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7A</xref>).

Furthermore, interferon gamma (IFNG) and antigen presentation machinery (APM1) protein signatures (<xref rid="R128" ref-type="bibr">Thorsson et al., 2019</xref>) appeared to track the immune score in all PAM50 subtypes except LumA, where they were lower than in Basal (cluster 4; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7A</xref>).

Thus, acquired immune response hallmarks generally appear not to be activated in LumA, whereas other PAM50 subtypes, including LumB, exhibit features consistent with activation of acquired immunity, a finding consistent with previous comprehensive immune cell profiling of the METABRIC dataset (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Curtis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R133" ref-type="bibr">Varn et al., 2016</xref>).

The mean expression level of GO NER proteins was also negatively correlated with PD-L1 RNA specifically in the luminal but not the basal PAM50 subtypes in the TCGA retrospective study, providing supportive evidence of these associations (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Because increased PD-L1 expression has been associated previously with DNA repair deficiency in breast tumors (<xref rid="R97" ref-type="bibr">Parkes et al., 2016</xref>), and loss of expression of NER and BER genes was associated with resistance to endocrine therapy in ER+ BRCA (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Anurag et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Haricharan et al., 2017</xref>), the consistent anti-correlation of NER proteins with PD-L1 expression suggests therapeutic potential for immunotherapy in endocrine-resistant ER+ BRCA. Importantly, low protein levels for the GO NER pathway were associated with high mutation load in luminal but not basal samples (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7E</xref>). Upregulated immune checkpoint components in endocrine therapy-resistant LumB BRCA have been noted previously (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Anurag et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that NER deficiency is a potential link between upregulated immune checkpoints and endocrine therapy resistance. Because the GO BP NER pathway contains genes that overlap with other DNA repair pathways, pairwise Spearman correlations of immune features with scores from <xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S6</xref> for specific DNA repair pathways were examined together with the negatively correlated GO BP pathways. Although the unique NER protein score was not significantly anti-correlated with PD-L1, it was negatively correlated with the CIBERSORT immune score (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>; <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S7</xref>). Indeed, nearly all SSBR pathways, which include BER, mismatch repair (MMR), and NER, were anti-correlated with the CIBERSORT as well as the protein-derived stimulatory and inhibitory immune modulator scores, associations that were confirmed in the retrospective dataset. As with NER, the associations between low levels of other SSBR protein levels and an active tumor microenvironment appeared to be specific for PAM50 luminal tumors and were not observed in basal-like tumors (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7F</xref>; <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S7</xref>).</p>

Notably, differences in ATM activity were present only in phosphoproteomic data, with the RNA and protein levels showing no significant differences between PAM50 luminal and basal subtypes (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7G</xref>).

          <title>PG Analysis of Rb Status May Inform the Response to CDK4/6 Inhibitor Therapy</title>
          <p id="P27">Proliferation rate is a critical prognostic feature in BRCA, and the cell cycle is a target for endocrine therapy (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Ellis et al., 2017</xref>) and CDK4/6 inhibition in ER+, ERBB2− advanced BRCA (<xref rid="R100" ref-type="bibr">Pernas et al., 2018</xref>). CDK4 and CDK6, in complex with Cyclin D, promote cell cycle progression by phosphorylating and inactivating the Retinoblastoma transcriptional inhibitor (Rb) during G1, whereas the Cyclin E/CDK2 complex further contributes to inhibition of Rb during G1-S transition (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Goel et al., 2018</xref>). To compare PG features with cell cycle control in hormone receptor (HR)+/ERBB2 PG− and triple-negative BRCA (TNBC) tumors, the multi-gene proliferation score (MGPS; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S6</xref>) was generated for each sample (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Ellis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R142" ref-type="bibr">Whitfield et al., 2002</xref>). Multi-omics analyses of Cyclin E (<italic toggle="yes">CCNE1</italic>) and CDK2, stemness scores, E2F activity scores (derived from their target genes in the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB; <xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">Liberzon et al., 2015</xref>), and CDK2 activity scores (derived from kinase target sites; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Hornbeck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Krug et al., 2019</xref>) revealed positive correlations with MGPSs in both groups (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>; <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S7</xref>), although the MGPS was higher in TNBC than in HR+/ERBB2− samples (p = 3.1 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Although Cyclin D1 (<italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic>) RNA, protein, and phosphorylation levels showed weak or no correlation with MGPS in both groups, these features were significantly higher in HR+/ERBB2− samples than in TNBC samples (p = 1.0 × 10<sup>−7</sup>, 1.7 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, and 0.023, respectively; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Despite lack of correlation between Cyclin D1 and MGPS, CDK4 and CDK6 activity levels were positively correlated with MGPS in HR+/ERBB2− samples but had weakly negative or no correlation in TNBC samples (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>; <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S7</xref>), suggesting that variability in CDK4/6 activity controls the variability in proliferation rates in HR+ BRCA but not in highly proliferative TNBC tumors. More distinctly, although Rb RNA levels did not show significant correlation with MGPS (Spearman rho = −0.069, p = 0.55 for HR+/ERBB2−, rho = −0.36, p = 0.060 for TNBC), Rb protein and phosphoprotein levels were significantly positively correlated in HR+/ERBB2− samples (Spearman rho = 0.24, p = 0.035 for protein and rho = 0.53, p = 1.06 × 10<sup>−6</sup> for median of all Rb phosphosites) but significantly negatively correlated in TNBC samples (Spearman rho = −0.54, p = 0.003 for protein and rho = −0.46, p = 0.015 for phosphorylation; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). Loss of Rb in TNBC leading to higher proliferation is consistent with the inhibitory role of Rb in cell cycle progression, but the association of higher Rb levels with greater proliferation in HR+ samples is contrary to its role as negative regulator of proliferation (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Goel et al., 2018</xref>). However, phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin-dependent kinases relieves this inhibition, and, consistent with these regulatory events, phosphorylation levels of Rb showed a stronger correlation with MGPS in HR+/ERBB2− cases than Rb protein levels (Spearman rho = 0.53, p = 1.1 × 10<sup>−6</sup> for mean of Rb phosphosites and rho = 0.24, p = 0.035 for protein; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S7</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P28">Consistent with expectations (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</xref>), the TNBC cases here were often <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutant, with active CDK2 and high levels of Cyclin E mRNA and phosphoprotein (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>; p = 1.04 × 10<sup>−7</sup> for CDK2 activity, p = 6.2 × 10<sup>−12</sup> for CCNE1 RNA, and p = 7.3 × 10<sup>−10</sup> for CCNE1 phosphoprotein, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests comparing TNBC with HR+/ERBB2−). However, there was a clear separation of TNBC samples into Rb-low and Rb-high phosphoprotein groups (n = 16 for Rb low and n = 12 for Rb high; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7I</xref>). This difference reflects Rb protein levels and CDK4/6 activity. For example, the inferred activities for CDK4 and CDK6 were higher in TNBC tumors with high levels of Rb phosphorylation compared with TNBC tumors with low Rb phosphorylation (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7J</xref>). Predictably, three of the four TNBC tumors with <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> mutations/deletions had low levels of Rb phosphorylation. The role of Rb in CDK4/6 regulation in TNBC was further probed by examining published cell line perturbation experiments from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) resource (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Iorio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R145" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). In this dataset, TNBC cells with <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> mutations or deletions did not respond to the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, whereas some wild-type TNBC lines were responsive (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). This suggests that knowledge of genomic Rb status could prove useful for repurposing CDK4/6 inhibitors for TNBC. However, TNBC samples often showed loss of Rb protein without a detectable genomic aberration in the <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> gene (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). This raised the question of whether Rb protein estimates could contribute to prediction of CDK4/6 inhibitor activity when the <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> status is wild type according to genomic analysis. Consistent with this hypothesis, further analysis of the GDSC data revealed examples of <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> wild-type cell lines with low levels of Rb protein that were indeed less responsive to CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). In general, Rb protein levels were correlated with response to palbociclib regardless of <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> genotype (Spearman rho = −0.61, p = 0.022; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). An exception was a cell line that had high levels of Rb protein but showed a poor response; however, this example harbored two hotspot <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> missense mutations in the pocket domain that is required for transcriptional repression (I388S and P515L) (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Chow and Dean, 1996</xref>). A second line with an in-frame deletion of N480 in <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> was resistant and had low Rb levels (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), consistent with reports that the N480 mutation may destabilize the Rb protein (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Harbour, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, analysis of Rb provides a good example of how PG data integration could enhance prediction of drug efficacy.</p>
          <p id="P29">To further investigate Rb-associated heterogeneity of proliferation within TNBC samples, TNBCtype was deployed (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Tumors classified as basal-like 1 (BL1) had higher proliferation scores, and most showed loss of Rb (seven of 10 BL1 TNBC samples were Rb low) as well as <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations (nine of 10) (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). The few <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> wild-type TNBC tumors were predominantly classified as luminal androgen receptor (LAR) tumors, with lower proliferation scores than BL1 tumors (p = 0.014, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), the highest protein levels of androgen receptor (AR) within TNBC, and the presence of <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). However, only two of the four LAR tumors were classified as Rb high, and AR protein did not show strong correlation with Rb protein (Spearman Rho = 0.27, p = 0.17) or phosphoprotein (Spearman Rho = 0.12, p = 0.54) levels in TNBC samples, in contrast to a previous study showing that 83% of AR+ samples were also Rb+ (by IHC) (<xref rid="R98" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2020</xref>). Of note, inferred mTOR kinase activity was also higher in TNBC tumors with elevated Rb phosphoprotein levels compared with Rb-low tumors, suggesting activation of the PIK3-AKT-mTOR pathway (p = 0.037, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7J</xref>) despite similar frequencies of PIK3CA mutations in both groups (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Thus, TNBC tumors with features demonstrating intact Rb and/or LAR represent a complex setting where PIK3CA, CDK4/6, and AR inhibition are therapeutic options to consider depending on the specific molecular characteristics of a particular tumor (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Asghar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">Lehmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R144" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p id="P30">The high-quality, multi-omics resource we created allows investigators to explore correlations between the genomic landscape and the downstream effects in the BRCA proteome, phosphoproteome, and acetylproteome, extending and refining analytical opportunities provided by prior studies (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Bouchal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Johansson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">Mertins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R130" ref-type="bibr">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>). Numerous observations with diagnostic or therapeutic potential emerged from our analyses. In the case of ERBB2+ BRCA, we suggest that integrated DNA and protein level analysis of the long arm of chromosome 17 could be a more quantitative approach than FISH/IHC. Integrated analysis of mutational signatures and DNA repair processes, I-TME profiles, and expression of targets for immune checkpoint (IC)-directed therapies defined subsets of LumA and LumB tumors with APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis or single-strand break repair defects that could benefit from IC treatment. Our data also hint that accurate PG assessment of Rb could prove useful as a predictive marker that could enable the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in a subset of TNBC.</p>
        <p id="P31">Deep, quantitative analyses of phosphorylation and acetylation by proteomics provided unique observations with potential clinical effects. For example, phosphoproteomics identified new connections between tumor suppressor loss and signaling, including upregulation of RIPK3 in <italic toggle="yes">MAP3K1</italic> mutant tumors, the WNT pathway mediator TNIK1 in <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic> mutant tumors, and the microtubule-associated kinase and neuroendocrine differentiation markers MAST4 and DCLK1 (<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) in <italic toggle="yes">GATA3</italic> mutant tumors. The first two findings suggest potential therapeutic directions in the difficult arena of targeting tumor suppressor loss, whereas DCLK1 inhibition via the small-molecule kinase inhibitor LRRK2-IN-1 has shown preclinical efficacy in some cancers (<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Kawamura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R123" ref-type="bibr">Suehiro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R141" ref-type="bibr">Weygant et al., 2014</xref>). Proteomics and acetylproteomics profiling in the context of metabolism also revealed, for the first time in a large BRCA cohort, marked differences in metabolic enzyme expression and acetylation between luminally- and basally-enriched subtypes, which may translate to a better understanding of metabolic vulnerabilities. Suppression of serine metabolic enzymes such as PHGDH selectively decreases proliferation in cells with elevated serine flux (<xref rid="R103" ref-type="bibr">Possemato et al., 2011</xref>), opening a potential therapeutic alternative for difficult-to-treat basal tumors (<xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">Mullarky et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R140" ref-type="bibr">Weinstabl et al., 2019</xref>). Our results suggest a synergistic interaction between hypoacetylation and elevated protein expression leading to increased activity of the glycolysis pathway in the NMF Basal-I subtype; in contrast, mitochondrial function appeared to be suppressed by hyperacetylation mediated by depleted SIRT3. Broad dependence of tissues on glucose and products of respiration suggests that the therapeutic window for targeting increased aerobic glycolysis or compromised TCA cycle enzymes is narrow (<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Luengo et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, the prospect of effective therapeutic targeting of metabolism is predicated on such nuanced insights into the metabolic phenotypes of specific disease states (<xref rid="R132" ref-type="bibr">Vander Heiden and DeBerardinis, 2017</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P32">There are limitations to this study and to multi-omics resource studies in general. Investment in prospective sample collection promoted data quality but meant that the sample population might not be optimized for subgroup or demographic representation. Use of cryopulverized bulk tumor material improved the depth and internal concordance of molecular analysis but sacrificed architectural information and the cellular resolution afforded by methods such as imaging mass cytometry (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 2020</xref>). Higher spatial resolution could be achieved by approaches optimized for smaller amounts of input material (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Hunt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R113" ref-type="bibr">Satpathy et al., 2020</xref>) or thoughtful integration of single-cell genomics and proteomics. The type of associations described throughout this manuscript are hypothesis generating and therefore cannot be understood in terms of firm biological conclusions or direct evidence of specific therapeutic interventions. Nevertheless, successful integration of deep-scale proteomics and post-translational modification (PTM) data from a large, prospectively collected BRCA sample set represents a substantial advance over prior genomics studies and an important complement to other PG efforts.</p>
        <p id="P33">Deep PG analyses of high-quality tissues from well-annotated cancer patient cohorts are an important resource for the clinical and research communities. The future direction of PG requires full integration of these analytical approaches into therapeutic trials and, ultimately, clinical care. Most clinical decision-making is based on core needle biopsies, hence our emphasis on microscaled workflows that reduce sample requirements in comparison with the surgical specimen-scale analyses described here (<xref rid="R113" ref-type="bibr">Satpathy et al., 2020</xref>). Microscaled PG will also facilitate detection of treatment perturbations that shed light on mechanisms of response and resistance to therapy. The results of such studies could then be used to develop candidate lists of peptides and their modifications for targeted, rapid, mass spectrometry-based assays that could be implemented in the clinic (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Gillette and Carr, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R148" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, we propose that strategic introduction of PG into clinical workflows will enable more rapid progress of precision diagnostics and therapeutics.</p>

Cases with any prior systemic chemotherapy, endocrine therapy or biological therapy for any cancer, or prior history of radiation therapy involving the breast such as mantle field radiation for Hodgkins Disease or radiotherapy for lung cancer, were excluded. Patients who were found to have a diagnosis other than invasive breast cancer as a result of the surgery were also excluded. Peripheral venous blood samples from each patient were collected prior to administration of anesthesia. Samples were qualified for the study if two or more tumor tissue core biopsies or surgical resection segments had a minimum mass of 200 mg and demonstrated greater than 60% tumor cell nuclei and less than 20% tumor necrosis on frozen tissue section review.</p>
            <p id="P43">To ensure tissue suitability for phosphoprotein analysis, the tumor and normal adjacent tissue specimens were collected in less than 30 minutes total ischemic time from interruption of the vascular supply and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound for processing at a common CPTAC-2 specimen core resource center. Pathologically qualified cases underwent further molecular qualification for extraction and co-isolation of nucleic acids. Tissue segments that were qualified both for pathology and for molecular integrity were shipped to the proteomic characterization centers. DNA and RNA from the same tumor segment and DNA from germline blood were further aliquoted and quantified per protocol. DNA quality was confirmed using gel electrophoresis and Nanodrop methods. RNA quality was confirmed using Nanodrop and Agilent bioanalyzer. Sufficient yield, a good gel score and passing value of 7 or greater RNA Integrity Number (RIN) qualified the DNA and RNA, respectively, for sequencing. The analytes were then shipped to the sequencing center.</p>
            <p id="P44">Patient history, procedural details, and other relevant clinical and diagnostic information were collected using case report forms. The corresponding clinical data were formatted and distributed through the CPTAC data coordinating center (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edu/study-summary/S039">https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edu/study-summary/S039</ext-link>). One year follow-up forms captured updated histories after completion of the initial treatment regimen. Deidentified Pathology Reports (AJCC 7th edition 2013) including ER (estrogen receptor), PGR (progesterone receptor), and HER2 (ERBB2) status and representative diagnostic slide images were utilized to review and qualify cases for this study. Final clinical assessment of hormone receptor status by IHC and FISH classified tumors as follows: ER and/or PR positive: 83; HER2 positive: 13; ER/PR/HER2 negative: 16; ER/PR negative with equivocal or unknown HER2 status: 12. PAM50-based classification of tumors was also performed (<xref rid="R96" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al., 2009</xref>), confirming that available samples represented all major subtypes, including 14 Her2 enriched (HER2-E), 29 Basal, 57 Luminal A (LumA), 17 Luminal B (LumB) and 5 Normal-like tumors (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). To support ERBB2-focused analyses, additional, centralized HER2 IHC was performed on sections from 68 tumors for which remaining tissue was available. ERBB2 clinical status was defined using a combination of the updated ERBB2 IHC scores where available (original IHC scores from the pathology reports were used for samples for which additional tissue was not available) and ERBB2 fluorescence <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) results from the pathology reports. Samples were classified in a manner consistent with ASCO-CAP guidelines (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cap.org/">https://www.cap.org/</ext-link>); specifically, clinical ERBB2 negative cases were those where the IHC score was 0 or 1+ or FISH was negative, clinical ERBB2 positive cases were those where the IHC score was 3+ and FISH was positive or not available or where the IHC score was 2+ and FISH was positive, and equivocal cases were those with IHC score of 2+ that lacked FISH confirmation or had a positive FISH result without IHC confirmation (ASCO guidelines require further testing for these equivocal cases, but this was not possible here). Central staining for ER was consistent with ER status from the pathology reports. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) status was classified using the clinical status for ER and PR from IHC and the ERBB2 proteogenomic (PG) status applied to all samples as described below. Samples that were positive for any of these markers were classified as TNBC negative whereas samples that were negative for all three were classified as TNBC positive (samples that were missing classification for ER or PR but negative for all other markers were classified as NA because clinical status of all 3 markers could not be assessed). The known propensity of TNBC to affect patients with African ancestry (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Dietze et al., 2015</xref>) was observed in the present dataset (p = 0.0009 versus Caucasian, Fisher’s exact test).</p>

To facilitate quantitative comparison between all samples across experiments, a tumor-only common reference sample was included in each 10-plex. A common physical, rather than <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> reference was used for this purpose for optimal quantitative precision between TMT-10 experiments. 125 unique samples representing 122 tumors and three process replicates were distributed among 15 10-plex experiments. Eighteen normal adjacent samples were also included in two additional 10-plex experiments, for a total of 17 10-plex experiments. For each experiment, nine individual samples occupied the first nine channels and the 10th channel was reserved for the tumor-only reference sample (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1B</xref>). To avoid systematic bias in sample processing or missing values in detection across the experiments, samples underwent stratified randomization before processing, with each intrinsic subtype proportionally represented in each processing tranche and subsequent incorporation to each 10-plex (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>).

              <p id="P49">Considerations informing generation of the common reference sample were that it needed to be available at the onset of discovery work, of adequate quantity to cover all planned experiments with overhead for additional possible experiments, and broadly representative of the population of breast cancer samples in the overall sample cohort. To ensure capacity for additional samples or experiments given a target input of 400 ug protein per channel per experiment, 12 mg total was targeted for reference material. To meet these collective requirements, 40 samples with an average of 2.7 mg total protein yield were selected based on hormone receptor status, including 9 triple negative, 12 HER2 positive, and 19 estrogen receptor positive specimens. After reserving 400 ug protein / sample for individual sample analysis, an additional amount of 300 ug for each of the 40 samples was pooled. The resulting 12 mg of pooled reference material was divided into 400 ug aliquots and frozen at −80°C until use.</p>
              <p id="P50">Making the internal reference representative of the study as a whole was particularly important since by definition only analytes represented in the reference sample would be included in the final ratio-based data analyses. To accomplish this goal, similar percentages found in the total sample population of specific subtypes were implemented in the internal reference. As noted, samples were selected on this basis of hormone receptor status, as PAM50 status was not available at the time of reference preparation; however, of the 40 samples included in the internal reference, 11 were subsequently shown to be basal, 7 were HER2+, 12 were Luminal A, 8 were Luminal B, 1 was normal-like, and 1 was not determined.</p>

The lysis buffer consisted of 8 M urea, 75 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 8), 10 mM NaF, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2 (1:100; Sigma, P5726) and cocktail 3 (1:100; Sigma, P0044), 2 μg/mL aprotinin (Sigma, A6103), 10 μg/mL Leupeptin (Roche, 11017101001), and 1 mM PMSF (Sigma, 78830). Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 minutes and protein concentrations of the clarified lysates were measured by BCA assay (Pierce). Protein lysates were subsequently reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol (Thermo Scientific, 20291) for 45 minutes at room temperature and alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma, A3221) for 45 minutes in the dark. Prior to digestion, samples were diluted 4-fold to achieve 2 M urea with 50mM Tris HCl (pH 8). Digestion was performed with LysC (Wako, 100369–826) for 2 hours and with trypsin (Promega, V511X) overnight, both at a 1:50 enzyme-to-protein ratio and at room temperature. Digested samples were acidified with formic acid (FA; Fluka, 56302) to achieve a final volumetric concentration of 1% (final pH of ~3), and centrifuged at 1,500 g for 15 minutes to clear precipitated urea from peptide lysates.

              <p id="P52">400 ug of desalted peptides per sample (based on protein-level BCA prior to digestion) were labeled with 10-plex TMT reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Scientific; Pierce Biotechnology, Germany). For each 400 ug peptide aliquot of an individual breast tumor sample, 3.2 mg of labeling reagent was used. Peptides were dissolved in 400 μL of 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.5) solution and labeling reagent was added in 164 μL of acetonitrile. After 1 h incubation with shaking and after confirming good label incorporation, 32 uL of 5% hydroxylamine was added to quench the unreacted TMT reagents. Good label incorporation was defined as having a minimum of 95% fully labeled MS/MS spectra in each sample, as measured by LC-MS/MS after taking out a 2 μg aliquot from each sample and analyzing 1μg. If a sample did not have sufficient label incorporation, additional TMT was added to the sample and another 1 h incubation was performed with shaking. At the time that the labeling efficiency quality control samples were taken out, an additional 2 μg of material from each sample was taken out and combined as a mixing control. After analyzing the mixing control sample by LC-MS/MS, intensity values of the individual TMT reporter ions were summed across all peptide spectrum matches and compared to ensure that the total reporter ion intensity of each sample met a threshold of ± 25% of the internal reference. If necessary, adjustments were made by either labeling additional material or reducing an individual sample’s contribution to the mixture, and analyzing a subsequent mixing control, until all samples met the threshold and were thus approximately 1:1:1. Differentially labeled peptides were then mixed (10 × 400 ug) and dried down via vacuum centrifuge, and the quenched, combined sample was subsequently desalted on a 500 mg C18 SepPak column.</p>

A desalted 4 mg, 10-plex TMT-labeled experiment (based on protein-level BCA prior to digestion) was reconstituted in 900 μL 0.0455% ammonium formate (pH 10) and 2% acetonitrile, loaded on a 4.6 mm x 250 mm column RP Zorbax 300 A Extend-C18 column (Agilent, 3.5 μm bead size), and separated on an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC instrument using basic pH reversed-phase chromatography. Solvent A (2% acetonitrile, 4.4 mM ammonium formate, pH 10) and a nonlinear increasing concentration of solvent B (90% acetonitrile, 4.5 mM ammonium formate, pH 10) were used to separate peptides. The 4.5 mM ammonium formate solvents were made by 40–fold dilution of a stock solution of 180 mM ammonium formate, pH 10. To make 200 mL of stock solution, slowly add 4.6 mL of 30% (wt/vol) ammonium hydroxide (Ammonia solution 28.0%–30.0% (NH<sub>3</sub> basis) ACS, 0.9 g/ml, Fluka) to ~150mL of HPLC grade water, then titrate to pH 10.0 with ~9.0 mL of concentrated formic acid (&gt; 95% Sigma-Aldrich); bring to final volume of 200 mL with HPLC grade water. The 96 minute separation LC gradient followed this profile: (min: %B) 0:0; 7:0; 13:16; 73:40; 77:44; 82:60; 96:60. The flow rate was 1 mL/min. For each 4 mg separation, 77 fractions were collected into a 96 deep-well 2mL plate (What-man, #7701– 5200), with fractions combined in a stepwise concatenation strategy and acidified to a final concentration of 0.1% FA as reported previously. An additional 12 fractions were collected from the 96 deep-well plate for fraction A, representing the early-eluting fractions that tend to contain multi-phosphorylated peptides. 5% of the volume of each of the 24+A proteome fractions was allocated for proteome analysis, dried down, and re-suspended in 3% MeCN/0.1% FA (MeCN; acetonitrile) to a peptide concentration of 0.5 μg/uL for LC-MS/MS analysis. The remaining 95% of 24 concatenated fractions were further combined into 12 fractions, with fraction A as a separate fraction.

This workflow consists of three sub-workflows: (i) Processing-For-Variant-Discovery workflow, which takes a single sample’s sequencing data in unmapped BAM (uBAM) format and outputs a clean BAM file and its index, suitable for variant discovery analysis, (ii) Haplotypecaller-GVCF workflow, which runs the HaplotypeCaller tool (<xref rid="R102" ref-type="bibr">Poplin et al., 2017</xref>) from GATK4 in GVCF mode on the BAM and BAI created in the previous step, and (iii) Joint-Discovery workflow, which conducts the joint-calling and VQSR-filtering portions of the GATK Best Practices for germline SNP and Indel discovery. In our analysis, Processing-For-Variant-Discovery was skipped, as our WES pipeline produced BAM files compatible for the next step of analysis and an Illumina-compatible interval list was used. Details regarding the specific Terra workflows used to conduct this analysis can be found in the public workspace (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/help-gatk/Germline-SNPs-Indels-GATK4-hg38">https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/help-gatk/Germline-SNPs-Indels-GATK4-hg38</ext-link>).

              <p id="P62">The raw Illumina sequence data from HiSeq4000 was demultiplexed and converted to .fastq files. Read quality was examined using FastQC (version 0.10.1) and adaptor and low quality sequences were trimmed using Trim Galore (version 0.3.3) using a quality score cutoff of Q &lt; 30 and Length &lt; 50 bp.. Trimmed reads were mapped to the hg19 reference genome using MapSplice (version 2.1.8). Transcripts were assembled and RNA expressions were quantified in Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) using Cufflinks (v2.1.1) (<xref rid="R129" ref-type="bibr">Trapnell et al., 2010</xref>) and transcript coverage was calculated using (bedtools version 2.20.1). Relevant QC metrics and statistics can be found in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1B</xref>. Derived data matrix of FPKM values was further processed in R. FPKM values of transcripts mapping to the same HGNC symbol were averaged within a sample to create a gene-centric data matrix. FPKM values of 0 were considered as missing values and replaced by NA before applying log2 transformation. For integrative multi-omics subtyping, we first normalized each gene by the median log2(FPKM) across all tumors (gene-centering) before applying a robustified z-score transformation (median-centered, MAD-scaled) per sample.</p>

Similar MS/MS spectra acquired on the same precursor m/z within ± 40 s were merged. MS/MS spectra were excluded from searching if they failed the quality filter by not having a sequence tag length &gt; 0 (i.e., minimum of two masses separated by the in-chain mass of an amino acid) or did not have a precursor MH+ in the range of 800–6000. MS/MS spectra were searched against a RefSeq-based sequence database containing 37,579 proteins mapped to the human reference genome (hg19) obtained via the UCSC Table Browser (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables">https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables</ext-link>) on September 14, 2016, with the addition of 13 proteins encoded in the human mitochondrial genome, 150 common laboratory contaminant proteins, and 553 non-canonical small open reading frames (38,295 total sequences). Scoring parameters were ESI-QEXACTIVE-HCD-v2, for whole proteome datasets, and ESI-QEXACTIVE-HCD-v3, for phosphoproteome datasets. All spectra were allowed ± 20 ppm mass tolerance for precursor and product ions, 30% minimum matched peak intensity, and “trypsin allow P” enzyme specificity with up to 4 missed cleavages. Allowed fixed modifications included carbamidomethylation of cysteine and selenocysteine. TMT labeling was required at lysine, but peptide N-termini were allowed to be either labeled or unlabeled. Allowed variable modifications for whole proteome datasets were acetylation of protein N-termini, oxidized methionine, deamidation of asparagine, hydroxylation of proline in PG motifs, pyro-glutamic acid at peptide N-terminal glutamine, and pyro-carbamidomethylation at peptide N-terminal cysteine with a precursor MH+ shift range of −18 to 97 Da. For the phosphoproteome dataset the allowed variable modifications were revised to allow phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine, allow deamidation only in NG motifs, and disallow hydroxylation of proline with a precursor MH+ shift range of −18 to 272 Da. For the acetylproteome dataset the allowed variable modifications were revised to allow acetylation of lysine, allow deamidation only in NG motifs, and disallow hydroxylation of proline with a precursor MH+ shift range of −400 to 70 Da.</p>

              <title>PSM quality control</title>
              <p id="P79">Identities interpreted for individual spectra were automatically designated as confidently assigned using the Spectrum Mill autovalidation module to use target-decoy-based false discovery rate (FDR) estimates to apply score threshold criteria. For the whole proteome dataset, thresholding was done in 3 steps: at the peptide spectrum match (PSM) level, the protein level for each TMT-plex, and the protein level for all 17 TMT-plexes. For the phosphoproteome and acetylproteome datasets, thresholding was done in two steps: at the PSM and variable modification (VM) site levels.</p>
              <p id="P80">In step 1 for all datasets, PSM-level autovalidation was done first and separately for each TMT-plex experiment consisting of either 25 LC-MS/MS runs (whole proteome), 13 LC-MS/MS runs (phosphoproteome), or 6 LC-MS/MS runs (acetylproteome), using an auto-thresholds strategy with a minimum sequence length of 7; automatic variable range precursor mass filtering; and score and delta Rank1 – Rank2 score thresholds optimized to yield a PSM-level FDR estimate for precursor charges 2 through 4 of &lt; 0.6% for each precursor charge state in each LC-MS/MS run. To achieve reasonable statistics for precursor charges 5–6, thresholds were optimized to yield a PSM-level FDR estimate of &lt; 0.3% across all runs per TMT-plex experiment (instead of per each run), since many fewer spectra are generated for the higher charge states.</p>
              <p id="P81">In step 2 for the whole proteome dataset, protein-polishing autovalidation was applied separately to each TMTplex experiment to further filter the PSMs using a target protein-level FDR threshold of zero. The primary goal of this step was to eliminate peptides identified with low scoring PSMs that represent proteins identified by a single peptide, so-called “one-hit wonders.” After assembling protein groups from the autovalidated PSMs, protein polishing determined the maximum protein level score of a protein group that consisted entirely of distinct peptides estimated to be false-positive identifications (PSMs with negative delta forward-reverse scores). PSMs were removed from the set obtained in the initial peptide-level autovalidation step if they contributed to protein groups that had protein scores below the maximum false-positive protein score. Step 3 was then applied, consisting of protein-polishing autovalidation across all TMT plexes together using the protein grouping method “expand subgroups, top uses shared” to retain protein subgroups with either a minimum protein score of 25 or observation in at least 2 TMT plexes. The primary goal of this step was to eliminate low-scoring proteins that were infrequently detected in the sample cohort. As a consequence of these two protein-polishing steps, each identified protein reported in the study comprised multiple peptides, unless a single excellent scoring peptide was the sole match and that peptide was observed in at least 2 TMT-plexes. In calculating scores at the protein level and reporting the identified proteins, peptide redundancy was addressed in Spectrum Mill as follows: The protein score was the sum of the scores of distinct peptides. A distinct peptide was the single highest scoring instance of a peptide detected through an MS/MS spectrum. MS/MS spectra for a particular peptide may have been recorded multiple times (e.g., as different precursor charge states, in adjacent bRP fractions, modified by deamidation at asparagine or oxidation of methionine, or with different phosphosite localization), but were still counted as a single distinct peptide. When a peptide sequence of &gt; 8 residues was contained in multiple protein entries in the sequence database, the proteins were grouped together and the highest scoring one and its accession number were reported. In some cases when the protein sequences were grouped in this manner, there were distinct peptides that uniquely represent a lower scoring member of the group (isoforms, family members, and different species). Each of these instances spawned a subgroup. Multiple subgroups were reported, counted toward the total number of proteins, and were given related protein subgroup numbers (e.g., 3.1 and 3.2 for group 3, subgroups 1 and 2). For the whole proteome datasets the above criteria yielded false discovery rates (FDR) for each TMT-plex experiment of &lt; 0.5% at the peptide-spectrum match level and &lt; 0.6% at the distinct peptide level. After assembling proteins with all the PSMs from all the TMT-plex experiments together, the aggregate FDR estimates were 0.41% at the peptide-spectrum match level, 1.6% at the distinct peptide level, and &lt; 0.01% (1/10,633) at the protein group level. Since the protein-level FDR estimate neither explicitly required a minimum number of distinct peptides per protein nor adjusted for the number of possible tryptic peptides per protein, it may underestimate false positive protein identifications for large proteins observed only on the basis of multiple low scoring PSMs.</p>
              <p id="P82">In step 2 for the phosphoproteome and acetylproteome datasets, variable modification (VM) site polishing autovalidation was applied across all 17 TMT plexes to retain all VM-site identifications with either a minimum id score of 8.0 or observation in at least 3 TMT plexes. The intention of the VM-site polishing step is to control FDR by eliminating unreliable VM site-level identifications, particularly low-scoring VM sites that are only detected as low-scoring peptides that are also infrequently detected across all of the TMT plexes in the study. In calculating scores at the VM site level and reporting the identified VM sites, redundancy was addressed in Spectrum Mill as follows: A VM site table was assembled with columns for individual TMT-plex experiments and rows for individual VM sites. PSMs were combined into a single row for all non-conflicting observations of a particular VM site (e.g., different missed cleavage forms, different precursor charges, confident and ambiguous localizations, and different sample-handling modifications). For related peptides, neither observations with a different number of VM sites nor different confident localizations were allowed to be combined. Selecting the representative peptide from the combined observations was done such that once confident VM site localization was established, higher identification scores and longer peptide lengths were preferred. While a Spectrum Mill identification score was based on the number of matching peaks, their ion type assignment, and the relative height of unmatched peaks, the VM site localization score was the difference in identification score between the top two localizations. The score threshold for confident localization, &gt; 1.1, essentially corresponded to at least 1 b or y ion located between two candidate sites that had a peak height &gt; 10% of the tallest fragment ion (neutral losses of phosphate from the precursor and related ions as well as immonium and TMT reporter ions were excluded from the relative height calculation). The ion type scores for b-H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, y-H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, b-H<sub>2</sub>O, and y-H<sub>2</sub>O ion types were all set to 0.5. This prevented inappropriate confident localization assignment when a spectrum lacked primary b or y ions between two possible sites but contained ions that could be assigned as either phosphate-loss ions for one localization or water-loss ions for another localization. VM site polishing yielded 63,416 phosphosites with an aggregate FDR of 0.44% at the phosphosite level. In aggregate, 70% of the reported phosphosites in this study were fully localized to a particular serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue. VM site polishing yielded 18,392 acetylsites with an aggregate FDR of 0.57% at the acetylsite level. In aggregate, 99% of the reported acetylsites in this study were fully localized to a particular lysine residue. The overall peptide identifications enabled calculation of enrichment rates (modified peptides/all peptides) for phosphopeptides (by IMAC) and acetylpeptides (by anti-acetyl-Lysine antibodies). Phospho-STY enrichment rates for each plex ranged from 88%–97% (plex 2 was an outlier at 71%). Acetyl-K enrichment rates for each plex ranged from 45%–69% (plex 11 was an outlier at 24%).</p>

For the phosphoproteome and acetylproteome datasets, a Variable Modification site comparison report limited to either phospho or acetyl sites, respectively, was generated using the protein grouping method “unexpand subgroups.” Relative abundances of proteins and VM sites were determined in Spectrum Mill using TMT reporter ion intensity ratios from each PSM. TMT reporter ion intensities were corrected for isotopic impurities in the Spectrum Mill Protein/Peptide summary module using the afRICA correction method, which implements determinant calculations according to Cramer’s Rule (<xref rid="R115" ref-type="bibr">Shadforth et al., 2005</xref>) and correction factors obtained from the reagent manufacturer’s certificate of analysis (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/90406">https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/90406</ext-link>) for TMT10 lot number QK226692A. A protein-level, phosphosite-level, or acetylsite-level TMT ratio was calculated as the median of all PSM-level ratios contributing to a protein subgroup, phosphosite, or acetylsite. PSMs were excluded from the calculation if they lacked a TMT label, had a precursor ion purity &lt; 50% (MS/MS has significant precursor isolation contamination from co-eluting peptides), or had a negative delta forward-reverse identification score (half of all false-positive identifications). Lack of TMT label led to exclusion of PSMs per TMT plex with a range of 1.8 to 3.1% for the proteome, 1.2 to 3.8% for the phosphoproteome, and 1.5 to 5.2% (outliers were plex 11 at 37% and plex 14 at 8.6%) for the acetylproteome datasets. Low precursor ion purity led to exclusion of PSMs per TMT plex with a range of 3.7 to 6.4% for the proteome, 2.1 to 2.9% for the phosphoproteome, and 3.0 to 6.5% for the acetylproteome datasets.</p>

              <title>Two-component normalization of TMT ratio</title>
              <p id="P84">It was assumed that for every sample there would be a set of unregulated proteins or phosphosites that had abundance comparable to the common reference (CR) sample. In the normalized sample, these proteins, phosphosites, or acetylsites should have a log TMT ratio centered at zero. In addition, there were proteins, phosphosites, and acetylsites that were either up- or downregulated compared to the CR. A normalization scheme was employed that attempted to identify the unregulated proteins and phosphosites, and centered the distribution of these log-ratios around zero in order to nullify the effect of differential protein loading and/or systematic MS variation. A 2-component Gaussian mixture model-based normalization algorithm was used to achieve this effect.

              <p id="P85">For each of the 122 patients’ tumors analyzed in this study, whole exome DNA sequencing and Illumina RNA-seq data generated from aliquots of the cryopulverized tumors and accompanying germline DNA samples were obtained under controlled access. Tumor-specific somatic DNA-variant calls and germline DNA-variant calls from the same individual, and splice junctions predicted from RNA-seq assemblies were generated as described above (Genomic Data Analysis). The proteogenomic database tool QUILTS v3.0 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://openslice.fenyolab.org/cgi-bin/pyquilts_cgi.pl">http://openslice.fenyolab.org/cgi-bin/pyquilts_cgi.pl</ext-link>) (<xref rid="R110" ref-type="bibr">Ruggles et al., 2015</xref>) was used to incorporate the germline and somatic non-synonymous single nucleotide variant calls (SNVs), indels, RNA-seq predicted splice junctions and gene fusions into a protein sequence database for each patient. The human RefSeq protein database (version 20160914) was used as a reference for the hg19 proteome and genome. QUILTS was run with the following thresholds for number of RNA-seq reads supporting splice junctions: both exon boundaries annotated (2), left boundary annotated (3), and no boundaries annotated (3).</p>
              <p id="P86">The QUILTS personalized databases for each patient were merged for searching the MS/MS spectra to accommodate the multiplexed samples used in LC-MS/MS data generation. Since each of the 15 plexes of TMT10 labeled tumor samples was prepared by combining 9 individual tumor samples plus an aliquot of common reference (which was a mixture of 40 tumors), each MS/MS spectrum could be derived from a peptide sequence shared by up to 49 individual tumors. One combined sequence database was made by concatenating the QUILTS-generated 122 individual FASTA files. When concatenating, variant and spliceform summary files for the whole exome and RNA-seg derived information, respectively, were generated with the Spectrum Mill Protein Databases utilities to enable subsequent matching of individual tumors to sequence identifiers and positions of genomic features. Completely novel junctions, with both boundaries matching no known exons, were omitted. The concatenated file was made non-redundant by removing repeat entries with identical full-length sequences. Protein sequences with length &lt; 7 amino acids were also removed. The resulting non-redundant, patient-specific protein sequence database containing somatic and germline single amino acid variants (179,768 sequences), spliceforms (283,149 sequences), indels (11,586 sequences), and gene fusions (1601 sequences), was concatenated together with the human reference database, RefSeq version 20160914 (38,281 sequences), to yield the database (514,385 total sequences) used for searches with MS/MS spectra.</p>
              <p id="P87">MS/MS spectra from the whole proteome datasets were searched in two stages: 1) all spectra against the RefSeq reference database, as described above, then 2) the remaining unidentified spectra against the patient-specific sequence database as described here. This was done to control the false-discovery rate since there are several orders of magnitude fewer high confidence PSM’s expected to the patient-specific sequences not present in the reference database. Search parameters other than the database were the same as the stage 1 searches.</p>
              <p id="P88">Separate PG event tables for the two primary PG event types, variants and spliceforms (including indels and frameshifts), were assembled with columns for individual iTRAQ 4-plex experiments and rows for individual PG events. PSM’s with a minimum identification score of 8.0 were combined into a single row for all non-conflicting observations of a particular PG event (i.e., multiple peptides containing altered coding sequence due to a frameshift, different trypsin missed cleavage forms of peptides that span a splice junction or contain an SAAV or new protein C terminus resulting from introduction of a novel stop codon, different precursor charges, different sample handling modifications of the same peptide, and repeat observations in adjacent bRP fractions). The representative peptide reported from the combined observations is the one with the highest identification score. A polishing step was manually applied to each table to further filter the PG events to reach a suitable PG-event level identification FDR. The following thresholds were applied to the representative peptide of each PG event: delta Rank1 – Rank2 score &gt; 1.0, minimum sequence length &gt; 7 (variants), &gt; 8 (spliceforms). Lower-scoring, infrequently observed spliceforms were further filtered to exclude those with both a score &lt; 9.3 and detection in &lt; 3 TMT10 plexes. Consequently, the final PG event-level cumulative FDR estimates were variants (1.0%), and spliceforms (1.1%).</p>

A PG event-level TMT ratio was calculated as the median of all PSM level ratios contributing to each event remaining after excluding those PSM’s lacking a TMT label, having a negative delta forward-reverse score (half of all false-positive identifications), or having a precursor ion purity &lt; 50% (MS/MS has significant precursor isolation contamination from co-eluting peptides). The ratios for all PG events for a patient were then standardized by subtracting the centering factor and dividing by the scaling factor of the protein-level TMT ratios for that patient derived from the results of the stage 1 search (reference database only). Since each MS/MS spectrum has 10 TMT reporter ions for 9 patients and the common control (40 patients), the detection of a rare PG event can typically be attributed to a specific patient when 1 ratio is significantly higher than the other 9.</p>

This behavior would be consistent with elution failure from a desalting step prior to fractionation. Consequently, the resulting quantitative data for 18 normal adjacent samples were considered to not meet quality standards for inclusion in subsequent analyses.

The CMAP (<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Lamb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R122" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian et al., 2017</xref>) is a collection of about 1.3 million gene expression profiles from cell lines treated with bioactive small molecules (~20,000 drug perturbagens), shRNA gene knockdowns (~4,300) and ectopic expression of genes. The CMAP dataset is available on GEO (Series <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GSE92742">GSE92742</ext-link>). For this analysis, we use the Level 5 (signatures from aggregating replicates) TouchStone dataset with 473,647 total profiles, containing 36,720 gene knock-down profiles, with measurements for 12,328 genes.

              <p id="P98">To identify candidate driver genes, proteome profiles of copy number-altered samples were correlated with gene knockdown mRNA profiles in the above CMAP dataset, and enrichment of up/downregulated genes was evaluated. Normalized log2 copy number values less than −0.3 defined deletion (loss), and values greater than +0.3 defined copy number amplifications (gains). In the copy number-altered samples (separately for CNA amplification and CNA deletion), the <italic toggle="yes">trans</italic>-genes (identified by significant correlation in “CNA driven <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">trans</italic> effects” above) were grouped into UP and DOWN categories by comparing the protein ratios of these genes to their ratios in the copy number neutral samples (normalized log2 copy number between −0.3 and +0.3). The lists of UP and DOWN <italic toggle="yes">trans</italic>-genes were then used as queries to interrogate CMAP signatures and calculate weighted connectivity scores (WTCS) using the single-sample GSEA algorithm (<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Krug et al., 2019</xref>). The weighted connectivity scores were then normalized for each perturbation type and cell line to obtain normalized connectivity scores (NCS). See (<xref rid="R122" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian et al., 2017</xref>) for details on WTCS and NCS. For each query we then identified outlier NCS scores, where a score was considered an outlier if it fell beyond 1.5 times the interquartile range of score distribution for the query. The query gene was a candidate driver if (i) the score outliers were statistically <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>-enriched (Fisher test with BH-FDR multiple testing correction) and (ii) the gene had statistically significant and positive <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>-correlation.</p>
              <p id="P99">For a gene to be considered for inclusion in a CMAP query it needed to i) have a copy number change (amplification or deletion) in at least 15 samples; ii) have at least 20 significant <italic toggle="yes">trans</italic> genes; and iii) be on the list of shRNA knockdowns in the CMAP. Of the genes satisfying these conditions, the top 501 genes (sorted based on the number of <italic toggle="yes">trans</italic>-events) were used for the analysis, and resulted in 910 queries (CNA amplification and deletion combined) that were tested for enrichment. 21 candidate driver genes were identified with Fisher test FDR &lt; 0.26 using this process.</p>
              <p id="P100">In order to ensure that the identified candidate driver genes were not a random occurrence, we performed a permutation test to determine how many candidate driver genes would be identified with random input (<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">Mertins et al., 2016</xref>). For the 910 queries used, we substituted the bona-fide trans-genes with randomly chosen genes, and repeated the CMAP enrichment process. To determine FDR, each permutation run was treated as a Poisson sample with rate <italic toggle="yes">λ</italic>, counting the number of identified candidate driver genes. Given the small <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> ( = 10) and <italic toggle="yes">λ</italic>, a Score confidence interval was calculated (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Barker, 2002</xref>) and the midpoint of the confidence interval used to estimate the expected number of false positives.

              <p id="P101">To identify how many trans-correlated genes for all candidate regulatory genes could be directly explained by gene expression changes measured in the CMAP shRNA perturbation experiments, knockdown gene expression consensus signature z-scores (knockdown/control) were used to identify regulated genes with α = 0.05, followed by counting the number of trans-genes in this list of regulated genes.</p>

Weights per feature and cluster were then aggregated by keeping the maximal normalized weight and multiplying with the sign of the z-score from the initial data matrix. Thus, the resulting transformed version of matrix <italic toggle="yes">W<sub>signed</sub></italic> contained signed cluster weights for each feature present in the input matrix.</p>

We trained random forest classifiers to discriminate these two groups–(A) PAM50 Luminal A in NMF LumA-I versus (B) PAM50 Luminal A in mixed Luminal A/B NMF LumB-I–using RNA-seq expression data from this study. The classifier was trained on genes common to our dataset and METABRIC, using the caret package in R. Cross validation (10-fold) over the training data was used to optimize model parameters. The final model was trained on the entire training dataset using the optimal parameters, and then used to predict NMF cluster assignment for all PAM50 LumA samples in METABRIC. Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests for statistical significance were executed using the survival and survminer packages in R. For comparison, survival information for PAM50 LumB samples in METABRIC were included.

Since LinkedOmics is a gene-centric database, proteome data was aggregated to the gene level according to the following process: for each subgroup, the HGNC symbol for the dominant protein in the subgroup, which was aggregated from common PSMs for the subgroup as well as unique PSMs for that protein by Spectrum Mill, was retained. If other proteins in the subgroup were reported (aggregated from unique PSMs by Spectrum Mill), the median of all entries from the subgroup for each unique HGNC symbol (other than the dominant protein gene) was retained.

          <p id="P170">(A) Schematic overview of PG data acquired for this cohort.</p>
          <p id="P171">(B) Unsupervised multi-omics identified four molecular subtypes. Samples are ordered by cluster and membership score in decreasing order.</p>
          <p id="P172">(C) Kaplan-Meier curves showing survival outcome of PAM50 LumA samples in the METABRIC database that were assigned by a random forest mRNA-based classifier to the NMF LumA-I (red) or LumB-I subtypes (green) compared with PAM50 LumB samples (blue). The p values were derived from log rank tests.</p>
          <p id="P173">(D) Heatmap showing the fraction of outlier values in each sample per protein. Proteins shown are kinases highly phosphorylated in each NMF cluster with an FDR of less than 0.01 using BlackSheep. Kinases shown in bold were detected as outliers in the prior study. The top panel shows PAM50 and NMF cluster membership as well as NMF membership score. The left panel indicates whether an inhibitor can be found for a given kinase using the DGIdb (Drug Gene Interaction Database). The right panels depict the abundance of the kinase activation loop and kinase substrate enrichment.</p>
          <p id="P174">(E) Heatmap showing q values from BlackSheep for enrichment of phosphorylation outliers (y axis) in samples with the indicated mutated gene (x axis). Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of samples in each mutational subgroup. Kinases with an FDR of less than 0.01 are shown, and light gray cells indicate kinases that did not show enrichment (FDR ≥ 0.01).</p>

          <p id="P179">(D) Significant associations (linear model coefficient FDR p &lt; 0.1) between protein expression of mitochondrial HDACs (histone deacetylases) and HATs (histone acetyltransferases) (columns) and Ac of mitochondrial metabolic proteins (rows).</p>
          <p id="P180">(E) Heatmap showing unsupervised clustering of nuclear protein acetylation, which was differentially expressed across NMF clusters (Kruskal-Wallis test, FDR p &lt; 0.05).</p>
          <p id="P181">(F) Protein scores of DNA repair pathways across clusters defined in (E). Wilcoxon test p value significance is shown compared with cluster 1. *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001, ****p &lt; 0.0001. BER, base excision repair; NER, nucleotide excision repair; SSBR, single-strand break repair; DSBR, double-strand break repair; FA, Fanconi anemia; HR, homologous recombination. Boxplots show 1.5× the interquartile range for each group, centered on the median.</p>
          <p id="P182">(G) Scatterplot showing global differential protein expression and Ac analysis results in cluster 1 versus cluster 3, representing the two subgroups of NMF Basal-I. The x axis shows the protein median fold change multiplied by −log10(FDR p value). The y axis shows the Ac site median fold change multiplied by −log10(FDR p value). Ac or protein changes were considered significantly different if FDR p value &lt; 0.05 and median fold change &gt; 0.5. The “Ac up in cluster 1” group is defined by significantly different Ac sites for which the Ac median fold change is positive and the protein change is not significant. The “protein up in cluster 1” group is defined by significantly different proteins for which the protein median fold change is positive and the Ac change is not significant.</p>
          <p id="P183">(H) Significantly different Ac sites in cluster 1 versus cluster 3 are found in HATs, their complex partners, histone proteins, and the NHEJ pathway. Boxplots show 1.5× the interquartile range for each group, centered on the median.</p>

          <p id="P196">(A) Correlation of protein levels with PD-L1 mRNA in PAM50 basal (x axis) and luminal (LumA and LumB, y axis) samples. Signed log10 FDR-corrected p values of Spearman-rank correlations are plotted. Protein data for PD-L1 was sparse in this study, but we observed high correlation between PD-L1 RNA and protein in the DP1 study, indicating that the RNA is a suitable surrogate for protein (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7C</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P197">(B) Although mutation load is correlated with the immune microenvironment in PAM50 luminal and basal BRCA, luminal samples with a high mutation load specifically show enrichment for APOBEC mutations. Luminal samples without APOBEC enrichment, luminal samples with APOBEC enrichment, basal samples (no APOBEC enrichment), PAM50 HER2E samples without APOBEC enrichment, and HER2E samples with APOBEC enrichment are ordered by increasing CIBERSORT scores. SBS13 and SBS2 are similarity scores for the whole-exome sequencing (WES)-derived mutation profile of a given sample with the corresponding COSMIC signature. APOBEC mutation fraction indicates the fraction of mutations that are APOBEC-associated mutations. APOBEC3G and APOBEC3B protein levels are also shown.</p>
          <p id="P198">(C) Nucleotide excision repair (NER), mRNA processing, and RNA splicing are negatively correlated with PD-L1 in PAM50 luminal but not basal BRCA. The bar graph shows normalized enrichment scores (NESs) for the top GO biological process gene sets correlated with PD-L1 mRNA in luminal samples (blue bars) together with the corresponding NES for basal samples (red bars) from the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of signed log10 p values from (A).</p>
          <p id="P199">(D) The mean log2 TMT ratio for proteins from the GO BP NER pathway is negatively correlated (Spearman) with PD-L1 RNA expression in PAM50 luminal but not basal samples in the prospective (top) and retrospective (bottom) datasets. Scatterplots show the mean log2 TMT ratios on the y axis and log2 mRNA ratios (median-MAD-normalized data) on the x axis. Blue points show PAM50 luminal (LumA and LumB) samples, red points show PAM50 basal samples, and lines show the linear fit for each group.</p>

          <p id="P202">(A) Heatmap of PG features related to regulation of cell cycle by the Rb protein. Samples are ordered by RNA-based multi-gene proliferation score (MGPS; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Ellis et al., 2017</xref>) within HR+ (ER+ or PR+) / ERBB2 PG− and TNBC subtypes. Correlation of each feature with the MGPS in each subtype is indicated by the bar plots along the side. The pathway diagram on the left depicts how the features included in the heatmap regulate G1-S progression to promote E2F transcription. Red boxes for SCNAs indicate gene amplification, whereas blue boxes indicate gene deletions. Phosphoprotein levels are represented by the median log2 TMT ratio of all phosphosites for a given gene. <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic> scores of kinase target NESs from single sample post-translational modification-signature enrichment analysis (PTM-SEA), of single sample GSEA NES values using MSigDb Hallmark sets, and of the stemness and CIBERSORT (CS) immune scores are also shown.</p>
          <p id="P203">(B) Plot of Spearman correlations of kinase activity scores (kinase target PTM-SEA NES) for each Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) with MGPS, showing strong positive correlations between CDK4 and CDK6 with MGPS in hormone receptor+ (HR+) / ERBB2 PG− but not TNBC samples. Density plots of the distributions of the activity scores in each of the groups are shown below the corresponding point for each kinase. P values were derived from Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.</p>
          <p id="P204">(C) Loss of Rb drives proliferation in TNBC samples, whereas phosphorylation of Rb is strongly associated with proliferation in HR+/ERBB2− samples. A scatterplot of Rb phosphoprotein (median of all phosphosites) log2 TMT ratios versus MGPS shows strong negative correlation between phospho-Rb and proliferation in TNBC samples, whereas phospho-Rb is positively correlated in HR+ / ERBB2 PG− samples. Points are colored by subtype. Red, TNBC; blue, HR+ / ERBB2 PG−.</p>
          <p id="P205">(D) Response to palbociclib (AUC, area under the dose-response curve) in ER+ / HER2− (circles) and ER− / HER2− (triangles) BRCA cell lines from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity to Cancer (GDSC) database (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Iorio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R145" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2013</xref>).
