        <abstract id="Abs1">
          <p id="Par1">Treatment paradigms for patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) are typically extrapolated from studies of bladder cancer despite their distinct clinical and molecular characteristics. The advancement of UTUC research is hampered by the lack of disease-specific models. Here, we report the establishment of patient derived xenograft (PDX) and cell line models that reflect the genomic and biological heterogeneity of the human disease. Models demonstrate high genomic concordance with the corresponding patient tumors, with invasive tumors more likely to successfully engraft. Treatment of PDX models with chemotherapy recapitulates responses observed in patients. Analysis of a HER2 S310F-mutant PDX suggests that an antibody drug conjugate targeting HER2 would have superior efficacy versus selective HER2 kinase inhibitors. In sum, the biological and phenotypic concordance between patient and PDXs suggest that these models could facilitate studies of intrinsic and acquired resistance and the development of personalized medicine strategies for UTUC patients.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p id="Par3">Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is a rare malignancy of the renal pelvis or ureter. Although it arises from the same urothelium and shares similarities to urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB), UTUC has distinct molecular characteristics that are of clinical significance. Unlike UCB, UTUC is a Lynch Syndrome-associated malignancy, with the most recent study demonstrating 8.7% of UTUC patients having a pathogenic germline mutation in a Lynch Syndrome-associated gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Given the relative rarity of this cancer type, treatment guidelines such as the recommendation for the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy are often extrapolated from UCB studies.</p>
        <p id="Par4">Recent genomic analyses of UTUC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> have identified a high incidence of potentially actionable genomic alterations including recurrent activating mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases (<italic toggle="yes">FGFR3, ERBB2</italic>), <italic toggle="yes">HRAS</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TSC1</italic>. These molecular profiling studies have also, however, identified significant genetic diversity among UTUC patients and a large number of genomic variants of unknown significance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Patient-derived UTUC models would facilitate the biological characterization of these variants of unknown significance and could also be used as preclinical models to test novel precision therapy approaches. Although PDX models have been developed from patients with UCB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, the development of UTUC PDX models has yet to be reported. Similarly, although there are several dozen bladder cancer cell lines in widespread use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, few are of upper tract origin. The lack of UTUC-specific cell line and animal models is thus a major hurdle to the development of more effective treatment strategies for this disease.</p>
        <p id="Par5">Here, we report on the successful development of UTUC models that reflect the genetic and biological heterogeneity of the human disease. In a subset of PDX models, chemotherapy sensitivity mirrors the drug sensitivity observed in the patients from which they were derived. Although HER2 alterations are common in patients with urothelial cancer, HER2-targeted therapies have had only modest clinical impact in this disease. We thus used a HER2-mutant PDX/PDC model to explore the biological basis for the limited clinical activity observed to date with HER2-directed therapies in patients with urothelial carcinoma.</p>

          <title>Integrated genomic and transcriptomic analysis of UTUC</title>
          <p id="Par6">With the goal of facilitating the development of personalized therapeutic approaches for patients with UTUC, we began in 2014 offering prospective clinical tumor sequencing using the MSK-IMPACT assay to patients with UTUC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. MSK-IMPACT is a targeted capture-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay that can detect mutations, copy number alterations and select gene fusions in up to 468 cancer-associated genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. To define the frequency of potentially actionable genomic alterations in UTUC, we analyzed 37 UTUC patients from this prospectively generated cohort and 82 UTUC patients previously analyzed retrospectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In total, tumor samples from 119 UTUC patients (118 nephroureterectomy and 1 resection of metastasis) were analyzed (Supplementary Fig.¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Consistent with prior studies in UTUC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, we observed frequent mutations in potentially actionable genes including <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> (47%), <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> (9%), <italic toggle="yes">HRAS</italic> (12%), <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> (16%) and <italic toggle="yes">TSC1</italic> (14%).</p>
          <p id="Par7">Gene expression profiling analyses of muscle-invasive bladder cancers have identified basal and luminal subtypes with the basal sub-type associated with a more aggressive disease course<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. To determine whether UTUC tumors can be similarly stratified, we performed whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>) on 80 of the 119 UTUC tumors for which MSK-IMPACT data was available. Patient demographic and clinical information for the RNA-seq cohort are reported in Supplementary Table¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. Clustering analysis based on the BASE47 gene classifiers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> found that 70 tumors (87.5%) had a luminal phenotype and 10 (12.5%) a basal phenotype (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). In addition, application of a consensus classifier developed by the Bladder Cancer Molecular Taxonomy Group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> revealed that the majority of UTUC in the cohort were luminal‚Äìpapillary (LumP, 66 tumors, 82.5%) sub-type including all 14 of the low-grade tumors. The remainder were classified as luminal unstable (LumU, 7 tumors, 8.75%), luminal non-specific (LumNS, 1 tumor, 1.25%), Stroma-rich (1 tumor, 1.25%) and basal/squamous type (Ba/Sq, 5 tumors, 6.25%). The latter had high expression of tumor basal markers including <italic toggle="yes">CDH3</italic> (Cadherin-3), <italic toggle="yes">CD44</italic> (CD44 antigen), <italic toggle="yes">KRT5</italic> (Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 5), <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">KRT6</italic> (Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 6) present in 4 of 5 of the Ba/Sq-type tumors. There was no significant sub-type difference between high- and low-grade tumors (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.5389, chi-square test).<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Integrated genomic and transcriptomic analysis of UTUC cancers.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Somatic genomic landscape of 80 UTUC tumors analyzed by MSK-IMPACT sequencing stratified by RNA sequencing analysis into luminal-like and basal-like subtypes defined using the BASE47 classifier (<italic toggle="yes">K</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and 5 subtypes based on a consensus molecular classification of muscle-invasive bladder cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

          <p id="Par8">Next, we explored differences in the frequency of common driver mutations in UTUC tumors with basal or luminal phenotypes as defined by the BASE47 classifier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The median tumor mutation burden was 4.21 (1.7‚Äì853.2) for the luminal and 4.56 (3.1‚Äì16.4) for the basal phenotype tumors (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.89). Somatic <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> mutations, which have previously been associated with a favorable prognostic outcome in UTUC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, were only present in luminal subtype. Conversely, there were no significant differences among the two subtypes in the percentage of patients with mutations in <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> or other driver genes commonly present in UTUC. Finally, using a curated knowledge base of the known biological effects of individual mutant alleles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, we observed that 39.3% of all somatic mutations identified were variants of unknown functional significance (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).</p>

Surgical specimens primarily obtained following radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) were grafted into immunocompromised NOD <italic toggle="yes">scid</italic> gamma (NSG) mice to generate patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with a subset also cultured in vitro to develop patient-derived cell line (PDC) models. In total, we successfully established 17 PDX models from 34 UTUC tumors (50% take rate). The tumor fragments at early passages of 16 among 17 PDX models were successfully preserved as frozen stocks for future implantation (Supplementary Table¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) to avoid late passage failure in tumorigenicity. Six PDC models among 24 tumors (6/24: take rate 25%) also survived beyond 10 passages (Supplementary Fig.¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Although not statistically significantly different, we did observe a trend towards PDX growth in tumors that were muscle-invasive (‚â•pT2 tumor stage, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.166) (Table¬†<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). All three tumors collected from distant (UCC3 [abdominal wall] and UCC11 [liver]) or lymph node (UCC32) metastatic sites successfully engrafted. The only tumor collected at endoscopic biopsy (UCC27) did not engraft.<table-wrap id="Tab1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clinico-pathological

          <p id="Par11">As the properties and composition of extracellular matrix (ECM) can influence cancer cell behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and as optimal preclinical models would be enriched with ECM similar to the original cancer tissue, we performed histological staining with Picro Sirius red followed by two-photon microscopy-second harmonics generation imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> on UCC36 and Masson‚Äôs trichrome staining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, which highlights the fibrous collagenous tracts in blue on UCC36, 17 and 19. Comparison of the collagen distribution in the tumor microenvironment of patient tumors and the corresponding patient-matched PDX models showed that both PDX and xenografts derived from PDC¬†retained collagen structure although the percentage area covered by collagen matrix in PDX models was reduced as compared to that of the corresponding patient tumors (Supplementary Fig.¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>, b). All three PDX models and two PDC xenografts also retained the structure of matching patient tumors based on the presence of a fibrotic capsule and the presence of collagen fibers within the body of the tumor as assessed by Masson‚Äôs trichrome staining (Supplementary Fig.¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par12">To confirm that the PDX and PDC models mirrored the genomic alterations present in the tumors from which they were derived, we performed targeted sequencing using the MSK-IMPACT assay for all 17 tumor/PDX pairs that successfully engrafted. Overall, the somatic mutational profiles of the patient tumors and resulting PDX models were highly concordant (72.7% concordance of known and likely oncogenic mutations). The top recurring mutated genes found in the PDX models were <italic toggle="yes">TERT</italic> (53%), <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> (59%), <italic toggle="yes">KDM6A</italic> (24%) and <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> (29%) (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). In 29% of the PDX, we observed PDX-specific deep deletions in <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A/CDKN2B</italic>, consistent with selection for loss of these tumor suppressor genes during the process of PDX engraftment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p id="Par13">Four of the 17 tumors that engrafted were derived from patients with microsatellite instability high (MSI-H, MSIsensor scores ‚â•10) tumors including three from patients with Lynch Syndrome (germline mutations were present in <italic toggle="yes">MLH1</italic> in UCC15 and <italic toggle="yes">MSH2</italic> in UCC36, UCC34). UCC17 had loss of MSH2 and MSH6 expression by immunohistochemistry in the absence of germline mutations in either gene. One additional Lynch case failed to engraft. As would be expected, all four MSI-H tumors had a high tumor mutational burden (range: 20.3‚Äì157.2 mutation per Mb, Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Mutation signature decomposition analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> for all four MSI-H tumor/PDX pairs revealed stable mutational signatures across passages with the MMR/MSI and aging signatures being most predominant (Supplementary Fig.¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Finally, the <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> R248C hotspot mutation, which has previously been shown to be enriched in Lynch Syndrome-associated UTUC as compared to sporadic UTUC tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, was present in 3 of the 4 MSI-H tumor/patient-matched PDX pairs (UCC17, UCC36 and UCC34). In sum, there was a high level of genomic concordance between radical nephroureterectomy-derived tumor samples and the corresponding PDX models (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) with only one PDX model, the hypermutated UCC34 PDX, displaying &lt;50% concordance of known or likely pathogenic mutations.</p>
          <p id="Par14">To assess the extent of genomic drift resulting from establishment of the PDX and PDC models, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on two cases (UCC03 and UCC30). Phylogenetic analysis of the WES data provided evidence of both linear and branched evolution in the tumors and PDX/patient-derived cell lines, as demonstrated by the presence of both private and shared mutations among samples derived from the same patient (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref>). Analysis of the UCC03 samples, which were derived from resection of an abdominal wall metastasis, demonstrated that both the cell line (CL) and PDX (X1, X2) were more genomically related to the metastasis than to the primary tumors (P1, P2). Mutational signature decomposition analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> of the UCC03 samples identified a predominant AID/APOBEC gene editing signature (Signatures 2 and 13), a common finding in bladder UC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, in both the tumors and the PDX models. A similar AID/APOBEC gene editing signature (Signatures 2 and 13) was identified in the tumor of patient UCC30, however, the AID/APOBEC(2) signature was lost in the corresponding PDX (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> and Supplementary Fig.¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5b</xref>).</p>

          <p id="Par21">Efforts to define the dependence of HER2-mutant urothelial carcinoma cells on HER2 signaling have been hampered by the lack of available preclinical models of HER2-mutant UC. As genomic analysis revealed that the UCC14 patient tumor and paired PDX harbored a hotspot mutation in <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> (HER2 S310F), we sought to leverage this model to explore the biological basis for the limited anti-tumor activity of HER2-targeted therapies in patients with UC. We thus generated a cell line from an early passage UCC14-PDX (UCC14-PDC) and assessed its sensitivity to neratinib, a HER2 kinase inhibitor. Both UCC14-PDC (IC50 508.3‚ÄânM) and MGHU3 (an <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> wildtype bladder cancer line, IC50 245.9‚ÄânM) were significantly less sensitive to neratinib as compared to CVX-4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> (a HER2 S310F-mutant cervical cancer line, IC50 56.8‚ÄânM) and BT-474 (an <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> amplified breast cancer cell line, IC50 0.1‚ÄânM)(Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). The greater concentration of neratinib required to inhibit UCC14-PDC cell growth as compared to other HER2 altered lines was consistent with the higher concentration of drug needed to inhibit activation of ERK, a downstream effector of HER2 (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Expression of phosphorylated AKT was also potently downregulated by neratinib in BT-474 and CVX-4 cells, but was unchanged in UCC14-PDC, suggesting that AKT pathway activation was not HER2 dependent in this UC model. Finally, the limited sensitivity of the HER2 S310F-mutant UCC14-PDC to HER kinase inhibition in culture was consistent with the relative insensitivity of the UCC14-PDX to neratinib therapy in vivo (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). In contrast to the lack of efficacy of neratinib, DS-8201a, a humanized HER2 antibody topoisomerase I inhibitor drug conjugate (trastuzumab deruxtecan, Daiichi-Sankyo) recently approved by the FDA for unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03690193?term=NCT03248492">NCT03248492</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, significantly inhibited UCC14-PDX growth.

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p id="Par22">A major hurdle to the development of personalized treatment approaches for UTUC has been the lack of laboratory models for biological and preclinical studies. Here, we report the development and biological and genomic characterization of PDX and PDC models from patients with UTUC. We find that the PDX and PDC models recapitulated the diverse landscape of genomic alterations in UTUC. Furthermore, in the select cases tested, the PDX models mirrored the sensitivity/resistance to standard cytotoxic agents of the patients from which the PDX models were derived.</p>
        <p id="Par23">Transcriptomic-based clustering analysis of 80 UTUC tumors using the BASE47 gene classifier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> found that the majority (70/80, 87.5%) of¬†tumors had a luminal phenotype. Further, application of the recently reported Bladder Cancer Molecular Taxonomy Group consensus classifier resulted in 66 of 80 tumors being classified as luminal‚Äìpapillary sub-type, including all 14 tumors with low-grade histology (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. These data are consistent with those of Robinson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and suggest that the luminal‚Äìpapillary sub-type is enriched in UTUC as compared to bladder cancer where only 24% of tumors were luminal‚Äìpapillary sub-type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par24">Another notable difference between urothelial carcinomas arising in the upper tract and the bladder is the significantly higher incidence of microsatellite instability in renal pelvis and ureteral tumors. It has been reported that patients with Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal cancer have diminished response to chemotherapy relative to patients with sporadic colorectal cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Our data suggest that a similar association between chemotherapy sensitivity and MSI status might exist in patients with UTUC. More specifically, we evaluated the sensitivity of two UTUC PDX models (UCC17 and UCC36) derived from patients with MSI-H tumors to platinum chemotherapies and gemcitabine and found that both were relatively resistant to these cytotoxic chemotherapies. Given recent studies suggesting that MSI may be a predictive biomarker of response to immune checkpoint blockade in multiple cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, these results suggest that MSI status may be useful in assessing whether UTUC patients should receive neoadjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy, or, instead be directed to immunotherapy-based clinical trials.</p>
        <p id="Par25">Despite the recent FDA-approval of erdafitinib for <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic>-mutated metastatic bladder cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, the clinical impact of targeted therapies in UC has been limited to date. <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> is altered by amplification and/or overexpression in various cancer types, and antibodies that bind to the extracellular domain of HER2 are now standard-of-care in <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> amplified breast and esophagogastric cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Our prospective clinical sequencing experience of over 44,000 patient tumors indicates that activating <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> mutations are more prevalent in both bladder and UTUC than in other common solid tumor types (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). However, the lack of <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> mutant models of UTUC has been a major impediment to the preclinical assessment of HER2-targeted therapies for UTUC patients.</p>
        <p id="Par26">As the UCC14-PDX and patient tumor from which it was derived harbored an activating hotspot mutation in the extracellular domain of HER2 (S310F), we leveraged this model to explore the biological basis for the limited clinical activity of HER kinase inhibitors observed to date in HER2-mutant UC patients. Consistent with the poor response of HER2-mutant UC patients to the HER kinase inhibitor neratinib as compared to HER2-mutant breast and cervical cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, the HER2 S310F-mutant cell line UCC14-PDC was significantly less sensitive to neratinib than the HER2-amplified BT-474 breast cancer and HER2 S310F-mutant CVX-4 cervical cancer cell lines. The relative lack of neratinib sensitivity of the UCC14 cell line was consistent with the higher doses of neratinib required to inhibit downstream ERK signaling in this cell line model as compared to BT-474 and CVX-4 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. This result suggests that the variable sensitivity of different tumor lineages to HER2-directed therapies as reported in a recent basket trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, is likely due, at least in part, to differences among cancers in their dependence on HER2 signaling for tumor growth and survival.</p>
        <p id="Par27">Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> recently reported that the HER2 antibody drug conjugate ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) has significant clinical activity in HER2-mutant lung cancer, even in tumors with low HER2 expression. One hypothesis as to why HER2-mutant tumors with low HER2 expression are sensitive to T-DM1 is that mutation of HER2 may increase the efficiency of receptor internalization following antibody binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Consistent with this finding, the UCC14-PDX was highly sensitive to DS-8201a, a HER2 antibody drug conjugate, which was recently approved by the FDA for unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In sum, the data highlight the potential ability of PDX models to guide the development of clinical trials for UTUC patients and suggest that antibody drug conjugates targeting HER2 may be more effective in UTUC patients than selective HER2 kinase inhibitors.</p>
        <p id="Par28">A limitation of the current study is that detailed biological characterization of the large number of variants of unknown significance identified in the PDX models is beyond the capability of any single laboratory.

          <p id="Par39">UCC14-PDC (<italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> S310F mutated bladder cancer), BT-474 (<italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> amplified breast cancer), MGHU3 (<italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> wildtype bladder cancer, kindly provided by Dr. Margaret Knowles) and CVX-4 (<italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> S310F mutated cervical cancer) cells were treated with neratinib (Puma Biotechnology) at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000‚ÄânM. For growth assays, cells were seeded into 6-well plates. After allowing 24‚Äâh for adherence, cells were then counted at Day 0 time point, or at Day 5 post treatment with neratinib or DMSO using the Vi-CELL XR 2.03 (Beckman Coulter). Growth curves were generated from the averages of at least 3 experiments in duplicate (¬±SE) by plotting percent growth [(mean cell number at drug dose D5‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâmean cell number of control D0)/(mean cell number of DMSO D5‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâmean cell number of control D0)‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ100)] against drug concentration. For in vivo drug studies, a UCC14-PDX tumor was mechanically dissociated, resuspended in Matrigel at 1:1 and subcutaneously injected into the flanks of male NSG mice (Jackson Laboratories). Once tumors reached an average volume of 100 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were randomized to receive either vehicle control (0.5% methylcellulose/0.2% Tween 80 for neratinib, PBS for DS-8201a), neratinib, or DS-8201a (Daiichi-Sankyo). The dosing schedules were as follows: neratinib at 20‚Äâmg/kg p.o. daily 5 days/week, DS-8201a at 10‚Äâmg/kg i.v. once every 3 weeks. Tumors were measured twice a week using calipers. Interested parties should contact Dr. Alessandro Santin for CVX-4 and Dr. Margaret Knowles for MGHU3 cell lines.</p>
          <p id="Par40">For western blot studies, cells were seeded into 60‚Äâmm dishes. At 75% confluence in log phase growth, cells were treated with neratinib at 0‚Äì250‚ÄânM for 1‚Äâh and then lysed in 1% NP-40 lysis buffer or RIPA buffer and processed for immunoblotting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. For primary antibodies, phospho-antibodies were used at 1:500 in TBST/5%BSA and totals were used at 1:1000 TBST/5% BSA with incubation overnight at 4‚Äâ¬∞C. Secondary antibodies were used at 1:2000 TBST/5% BSA for 1‚Äâhr at room temperature. ERK (#9102), p-ERK (T202/Y204) (#9101), AKT (#9272) and p-AKT (Ser473) (#9271) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. Proteins were visualized using the Fuji LAS-4000 (GE LifeSciences).</p>

          <p id="Par41">A xenograft was deemed to have successfully engrafted when the tumor volume reached 1 cm<sup>3</sup> or the maximum tumor diameter reached 1.5‚Äâcm, and urothelial carcinoma was confirmed by histopathology of the grafted tumors. Clinical variables of patients and differences in engraftment rates were analyzed using¬†Fisher‚Äôs exact testing for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum¬†for continuous variables. Treatment effects on tumor growth were evaluated by two-way analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA, GraphPad Prism software Version 8). R/Bioconductor packages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> were used to analyze RNA-Seq data (DESeq2 package) and DNA mutations (maftools package). In addition, gene set variation analysis was performed using single sample GSEA (within GSVA package).</p>
