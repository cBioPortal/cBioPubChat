          <p id="Par1">The lack of multi-omics cancer datasets with extensive follow-up information hinders the identification of accurate biomarkers of clinical outcome. In this cohort study, we performed comprehensive genomic analyses on fresh-frozen samples from 348 patients affected by primary colon cancer, encompassing RNA, whole-exome, deep T cell receptor and 16S bacterial rRNA gene sequencing on tumor and matched healthy colon tissue, complemented with tumor whole-genome sequencing for further microbiome characterization. A type 1 helper T cell, cytotoxic, gene expression signature, called Immunologic Constant of Rejection, captured the presence of clonally expanded, tumor-enriched T cell clones and outperformed conventional prognostic molecular biomarkers, such as the consensus molecular subtype and the microsatellite instability classifications. Quantification of genetic immunoediting, defined as a lower number of neoantigens than expected, further refined its prognostic value. We identified a microbiome signature, driven by <italic toggle="yes">Ruminococcus</italic> <italic toggle="yes">bromii</italic>, associated with a favorable outcome. By combining microbiome signature and Immunologic Constant of Rejection, we developed and validated a composite score (mICRoScore), which identifies a group of patients with excellent survival probability. The publicly available multi-omics dataset provides a resource for better understanding colon cancer biology that could facilitate the discovery of personalized therapeutic approaches.</p>

        <p id="Par3">Although there has been a substantial amount of research conducted on biomarkers for primary colon cancer, the current clinical guidelines in the USA and Europe (including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines) only rely on the tumor-node-metastasis staging and the detection of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency or microsatellite instability (MSI), in addition to standard clinicopathological variables, to determine treatment recommendations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. MSI is caused by somatic or germline defective of MMR genes and leads to the accumulation of somatic mutations, neoantigens resulting in immune recognition and high density of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par4">The strength of the in situ adaptive immune reaction, as captured for instance by the evaluation of the density and spatial distribution of T cells (Immunoscore), is associated with a reduced risk of relapse and death independently of other clinicopathological variables, including MSI status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par5">However, despite the overwhelming evidence of the prognostic effect of the Immunoscore and other immune-related parameters in colon cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, a lack of association between gene-expression-based estimates of immune response and patient survival in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) cohort has been noted by the research community<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. TCGA, for its genomic data richness and curation, represents the preeminent dataset for omics analyses; however, the collecting of comprehensive clinical data, including survival outcomes was neither a primary objective of TCGA nor a practical possibility in view of its worldwide scope and time constraints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. As such, the limited patient follow-up data associated with TCGA-COAD and other TCGA datasets has hindered statistically rigorous survival analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In addition, TCGA did not include dedicated assays for T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis or microbiome characterization, which was later performed using bulk DNA and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data and includes only few healthy solid tissue (for example healthy colon) samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, as TCGA focused initially on cataloging genomic and molecular changes that occur in cancer cells, sample inclusion criteria based on stringent tumor purity cutoffs were imposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, potentially biasing the population toward less-immune- or stroma-rich tumor specimens.</p>
        <p id="Par6">In recent years, while quantitative features of primary colon cancer, including those that are cancer cell intrinsic, immunological, stromal or microbial in nature, have been reported to be significantly associated with clinical outcomes, individually<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, knowledge of how their interactions impact patient outcome is fragmentary.</p>
        <p id="Par7">To dissect this phenotypic complexity with respect to outcomes, we used orthogonal genomic platforms to rigorously profile a large collection of primary colon cancer specimens (unselected for tumor cell purity) and matched healthy colon tissue, complemented with curated clinical and pathological data annotation and appropriate follow-up.</p>

          <title>The ICR outperforms conventional molecular classifications</title>
          <p id="Par9">A modular immune gene signature capturing the continuum of cancer immune surveillance, termed as the Immunologic Constant of Rejection (ICR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, had been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We subsequently optimized and condensed it into a fixed 20-gene panel, showing prognostic significance in different cancer types (for example, melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, bladder cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, neuroblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and soft-tissue sarcoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>). The ICR also correlates with response to immunotherapy across multiple cancer types, including breast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and non-small-cell lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The ICR signature includes gene modules that reflect the activation of type 1 T (T<sub>H</sub>1) cell signaling, expression of CXCR3/CCR5 chemokine ligands, cytotoxicity and counter-activation of immunoregulatory mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par10">As a first objective, we conducted a validation of the ICR signature on the AC-ICAM cohort. This objective was predefined before data were generated (prospective validation of retrospectively collected samples; <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> provides detail). A consensus-clustering approach based on the ICR genes (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>) segregated the cohort in three clusters/immune subtypes: ICR high (hot tumors), ICR medium and ICR low (cold tumors) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Systematic transcriptomic analysis using 103 previously defined immune traits (<xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) revealed co-clustering of these traits into seven different modules (M1–M7) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), with ICR belonging to M2 (lymphocyte infiltration signature), together with other immune signatures, including the tumor inflammation signature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. We then characterized the immune disposition in relation to Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, a well-defined transcriptomic-based classification of colon cancers. CMS categories include CMS1/immune, CMS2/canonical, CMS3/metabolic and CMS4/mesenchymal. Overall, <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-SNE) plotting of the whole expression data segregated CMS1–CMS3 samples, but a high heterogeneity was observed for CMS4 (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, left). Within CMS subtypes, ICR varied considerably (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, right). While most of the CMS1 samples were ICR high, implying immune activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, CMS4 samples were spread across the three ICR immune subtypes. According to the anatomic location, a progressive right-to-left colon enrichment (for CMS2) and depletion (for CMS1) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), was evident<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. ICR score (average of the 20 ICR genes) and leukocyte subsets enrichment scores, showed only a modest decrease from right-to-left colon, with ICR high being more prevalent in cecum versus rectosigmoid tumors (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The enrichment scores of cancer-cell-related pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> were clearly distinct across CMS subtypes (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). ICR score correlated negatively with certain cancer-cell pathways in all CMS subtypes (for example, WNT-β catenin and NOTCH signaling), whereas a positive correlation with immunosuppressive and stromal-related pathways (for example, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, epithelial to mesenchymal transition and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling) was only observed in CMS4 tumors (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par11">The abundance of natural killer (NK) cell and T cell subsets was the highest in the ICR-high immune subtype across all CMS, whereas other leukocyte subsets were more variable (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, heat map). Conversely, the abundance of fibroblast and endothelial cells was increased in CMS4, irrespective of ICR assignment, confirming the increased stromal content in these tumors. Based on statistical significance, the association between ICR score and progression-free survival (PFS) was stronger than what observed for any stromal cell or leukocyte subsets; similar results were obtained for the association with overall survival (OS) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, forest plot).</p>
          <p id="Par12">ICR immune subtypes had distinct OS and PFS, which gradually increased from ICR low to high (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). As expected, CMS4 was associated with poor survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>; however, ICR reverted this negative trend in survival, with ICR high being associated with longer OS even within the CMS4 group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e–g</xref>). Conversely, CMS did not stratify the ICR-high cluster (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). ICR remained significantly associated with improved OS in the Cox multivariate analysis (together with pathological stage and age), whereas microsatellite instability (MSI) status and CMS did not (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The relationships between ICR and CMS depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> were confirmed in the TCGA colon cancer cohort (TCGA-COAD; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Overall, in TCGA, the survival differences were attenuated (in the PFS analysis) or absent (in the OS analysis) for ICR, immune infiltrates and CMS. Nevertheless, ICR still stratified survival in patients with CMS4 cancers (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>; PFS analysis). Overall, we validated the prognostic role of ICR in colon cancer.</p>

          <title>ICR captures tumor-enriched, clonally expanded T cells</title>
          <p id="Par13">It has been reported that only a minority of T cells infiltrating a tumor tissue is specific for tumor antigens (less than 10%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Most intratumoral T cells are therefore referred to as bystander T cells. We then sought to address why ICR, which measures T cell infiltration and functional orientation without considering antitumor specificity, bears such a strong prognostic connotation.</p>
          <p id="Par14">A dedicated deep sequencing of the <italic toggle="yes">TRB</italic> gene by immunoSEQ was performed on all samples (114 tumors and 9 healthy colon tissues) with sufficient DNA for this assay. <italic toggle="yes">TRB</italic> gene sequence information was also extracted from bulk RNA-seq using MiXCR (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 341)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Among stromal cell and leukocyte subsets (measured by RNA-seq), the strongest correlation with the number of conventional (αβ) T cells with a productive TCR (immunoSEQ TCR productive DNA templates), was observed for estimates of T cell subsets (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), implying robustness of DNA and RNA-based measurements; however, the strongest correlation with immunoSEQ TCR productive clonality was observed for ICR score (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.61), substantiating the ability of ICR to capture additional features beyond T cell abundance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>). Despite the inherent limitation in terms of sensitivity and specificity of TCR repertoire analysis using bulk RNA-seq, MiXCR TCR clonality correlated well with immunoSEQ TCR clonality (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.64) as well as with ICR (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.40) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Consistently, among ICR clusters (overall and within CMS categories), the immunoSEQ TCR clonality was the highest in the ICR-high group and in the CMS1/immune group among CMS subtypes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), which has the highest proportion of ICR-high tumors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Using the whole transcriptome (18,270 genes), six out of the top ten genes positively correlating with TCR immunoSEQ clonality were represented by ICR genes (<italic toggle="yes">IFNG</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">STAT1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">IRF1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CCL5</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">GZMA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CXCL10</italic>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>).

          <p id="Par15">For nine patients, immunoSEQ TCR profiles were available on both the tumor and matched healthy colon tissue. This allowed the definition of overlap between T cell clones observed in the tumor and healthy colon sample for each of these patients (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">4b,c</xref>).

          <title>Somatic alterations associated with weak immune response</title>
          <p id="Par17">We sought to identify potential drivers of immune responsiveness related to cancer cell somatic alterations, such as mutations and copy-number variations by performing WES (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">5a,b</xref>) on 281 tumor samples and corresponding healthy tissue.</p>
          <p id="Par18">In terms of somatic mutations, the tumor mutational burden (TMB) of the AC-ICAM dataset was highly comparable to the TCGA-COAD cohort (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), as were the clinicopathological parameters (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Unlike the TCGA-COAD cohort, however, inclusion of samples in our study did not depend on tumor purity. In fact, stromal and immune content (ESTIMATE score) and the infiltration of individual lymphocyte subpopulations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) was significantly increased in the AC-ICAM compared to the TCGA-COAD datasets, whereas the opposite was observed for cancer-cell-intrinsic signatures (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). This was paralleled by a lower proportion of CMS1 and a higher proportion of ICR low in the TCGA-COAD compared to AC-ICAM (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). While the same proportion of MSI-high (MSI-H) cases was observed in the two cohorts (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), MSI-H TCGA-COAD samples displayed lower levels of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>), which is consistent with a positive selection of less-immune-infiltrated specimens. We then subsampled the cohort 100 times using two methodologies: one was random and the other was on a subgroup of samples with an ESTIMATE distribution that approximates that of the TCGA-COAD. The random subsampling resulted in tripling the number of subsets in which the Cox proportional regression showed a statistically significant survival benefit of the ICR score compared to the sampling method approximating the TCGA-COAD ESTIMATE distribution (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, chi-squared test) (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>).

          <p id="Par24">While we observed no difference in OS between high versus low TMB (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>) tumors, the presence of genetic immunoediting (GIE; calculated as the ratio of the observed versus the expected number of neoantigens) was nevertheless associated with improved OS (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). We then explored a composite score, called the immunoediting score (IES), based on both ICR cluster assignment and presence or absence of GIE (IES1 = ICR low and no GIE; IES2 = ICR low and GIE; IES3 = ICR high and no GIE; IES4 = ICR high and GIE) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), similar to what was proposed in metastatic colon cancer by combining the Immunoscore and GIE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. We propose that the combination of the two parameters may more accurately reflect the presence of an active, antitumor immune response. Consistently with this hypothesis, a progressive increase of OS was observed from IES1 to IES4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). The additive value of combining ICR with GIE was confirmed in ICR-medium samples (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>), which served here as an internal validation. While the TMB was higher in GIE versus non-GIE samples, GIE was observed in a significant proportion of both hypermutated and non-hypermutated tumors (55.1 versus 38.7%) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Patients with IES4 tumors, of which ∼50% were hypermutated or MSI-H (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>), indeed demonstrated improved survival, with similar survival across stage I–III (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>). No conclusion could be made in the IES4 stage IV subgroup as it only included two patients. No statistically significant difference was observed in terms of stage distributions and IES (chi-squared test, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.46; Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6g</xref>). IES remained significantly associated with OS in a multivariable Cox model corrected by stage (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.045; Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6h</xref>). IES categories also differed in term of TCR clonality, with increasing clonality from IES1 to IES4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). The same trend was observed within the ICR-medium subgroup, in which the TCR clonality was increased (although not significantly) in the GIE samples compared to the non-GIE samples (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6i</xref>). The positive correlation between IES and TCR clonality was statistically significant when corrected for ICR score using multiple regression analysis and was confirmed by local polynomial regression analysis (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6j,k</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that the level of immune editing (IES) accurately reflects the level of a protective antitumor immune response driven by clonally expanded T cells.</p>

On the AC-ICAM246, we ran a multivariable elastic-net OS Cox regression model that selected 41 features (taxa) with a coefficient different to zero (associated with differential risk of death; <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). We termed this list of taxa and associated coefficients MBR classifier (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). A score was assigned to each sample (MBR score) by applying the MBR classifier.

Low and high-risk taxa (according to MBR classifier) were spread across the different clusters (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">9b</xref>).

          <p id="Par32">A low MBR score (MBR &lt; 0, MBR low), in our training cohort (ICAM246, training set) was associated with a considerable (85%) reduction of risk of death (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5h</xref>). We confirmed the association between MBR low (risk) and prolonged OS in two independent testing sets (ICAM42 and TCGA-COAD cohorts), individually and combined (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5h,i</xref>, testing sets). The performance of the final MBR model was lower on the test sets than on the training set, which is typical for machine-learning models (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">10d</xref>); however, the concordance index of the final MBR model in both the test sets were superimposable to the ones obtained via cross-validation of the best MBR model on the training set (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">10d</xref>), substantiating that the model can generalize well to new (unseen) data.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p id="Par38">Our multi-omics approach allowed us to thoroughly examine the molecular characteristics of immune responsiveness in colon cancer and uncover interactions between the microbiome and the immune system. We found that a T<sub>H</sub>1 cell/cytotoxic immune activation, as captured by the ICR, immunoediting, concurrent expansion of TCR clonotypes and specific intratumoral microbiome composition, were associated with a favorable clinical outcome. ICR was associated with OS independently of MSI and CMS, which both lost statistical significance in the multivariate analysis. Its prognostic impact increased when combined with a metric capturing the genetic immunoediting (IES).</p>
        <p id="Par39">Using deep TCR sequencing in tumor and healthy tissues, we showed that the prognostic effect of ICR could be due to its ability to capture the presence of tumor-enriched and possibly tumor-antigen specific, T cell clones.</p>
        <p id="Par40">The AC-ICAM addressed the limitations of the TCGA colon cancer cohort noted by the scientific community<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and corroborated by our comparative analyses. While several studies have described associations between response to immunotherapy and the gut microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> and identified cancer-specific microbiome compositions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, comprehensive microbiome analyses focused on patients with primary colon cancer are lacking. By analyzing the tumor microbiome composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing in AC-ICAM samples, we identified a microbiome signature (MBR risk score) with strong prognostic value. This signature was derived from tumor samples, but there was a strong correlation between the healthy colon and tumor MBR risk scores, suggesting that this signature may capture the patient’s gut microbiome composition.</p>
        <p id="Par41">Additional analysis and technical validation using orthogonal platforms such as WGS and PCR indicated that the detected signal was driven by <italic toggle="yes">R.</italic> <italic toggle="yes">bromii</italic>. Correlation analyses between the MBR risk score and immune traits suggest a specific positive modulation of CD103<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells, which are critical for antitumor immune responses. We speculate that the identified consortium of bacteria favors optimal T cell priming mediated by CD103<sup>+</sup> dendritic cell activation and suppression of the myeloid compartment, leading to the induction of a partially protective antitumor immunity.</p>
        <p id="Par42">By combining the ICR and MBR scores, we were able to identify and validate a multi-omics biomarker (mICRoScore) that could predict exceptionally long survival in patients with colon cancer.</p>
        <p id="Par43">Studies on the gut microbiome compositions of patients receiving immunotherapy, including anti-CD19 CAR T cell treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, have shown favorable associations with <italic toggle="yes">Ruminococcus</italic> and or <italic toggle="yes">R.</italic> <italic toggle="yes">bromii</italic> and response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Here, we propose the <italic toggle="yes">R.</italic> <italic toggle="yes">bromii</italic> as the possible link between prognostic and predictive microbiome-based signatures. Our findings support the testing of adjuvant microbiota-targeted/dietary interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> aimed at decreasing the risk of recurrence and death in patients with colon cancer through the induction of an antitumor response against minimal residual disease.

        <p id="Par46">Our study has some notable limitations. While the cohort was relatively large and compares favorably with the TCGA-COAD colon cohort (for example, ~50% OS events more in AC-ICAM versus TCGA-COAD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>), it remains underpowered for stage-specific survival analysis. For the mICRoScore, we were unable to assess and quantify potential data overfitting as we did not reserve internal samples for this purpose; however, we observed a good performance of the mICRoScore in the external validation cohort (TCGA-COAD), which may be due to the combination of two biologically relevant variables (ICR and MBR) into the model. This combination likely contributed to the model’s impact and suggests that the mICRoScore might be generally applicable. We did not perform in situ spatial profiling, which could reveal more complex spatial immune–microbiome interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Additional research is needed to confirm the validity of the mICRoScore and investigate its potential applications in clinical treatment decision-making. Both the mICRoScore and IES could be tested in the context of cancer immunotherapy as predictive biomarkers. Data from the NIBIT-M4 trial and publicly available datasets suggest that the combination of the genetic immunoediting and ICR (IES) has predictive value in melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. The quantification of the immunoediting using WES data is an emerging subject of research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. These scores might also be explored to define a subgroup of patients with stage III tumors that could be eligible for a reduced chemotherapy regimen.</p>
        <p id="Par47">In conclusion, the AC-ICAM provided insight into the biology of colon cancer that could be utilized to establish clinical-grade prognostic or predictive biomarkers and to identify targeted therapies for personalized treatment approaches. We hope that further exploitations of our resource by physicians and scientists around the globe will lead to the discovery of new concepts within cancer research, ultimately improving life expectancy of patients suffering from this frequent and aggressive disease.</p>

Mutated epitopes with a median IC<sub>50</sub> binding affinity across all prediction algorithms used &lt;500 nM, with a corresponding wild-type epitope with a median IC<sub>50</sub> binding affinity &gt; 500 nM, were used as criteria to infer neoantigens. Predicted neoantigens were used to calculate the GIE value. We calculated the GIE value by taking the ratio between the number of observed versus the number of expected neoantigens. The expected number of neoantigens was based on the assumption of a linearity between TMB and the number of neoantigens. We therefore assumed that samples that have a lower frequency of neoantigens than expected (lower GIE values), display evidence of immunoediting. A higher frequency of neoantigens than expected indicates a lack of immunoediting, see calculations section for details.</p>

No human DNA depletion was used. The amplifications were performed on a Veriti 96-well Thermal Cycler (Thermo Scientific) with the following program: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 60 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 30 s, with a final elongation at 72 °C for 5 min. The presence of PCR products was confirmed by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel conducted at 80 V/cm in Tris-borate–EDTA (TBE) buffer. Amplicons were then purified using AgenCourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) according to the Illumina MiSeq 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation protocol. As positive controls, we included DNA from stool samples (extracted with QIAGEN QIAmp Fast DNA Stool Mini kit), using the same input of DNA as the one used for the AC-ICAM samples.

The final pooled product was paired-end sequenced at 2 × 300 bp using a MiSeq Reagent kit v3 on Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina) at the Sidra Medicine research facility. Sequencing was also performed on 27 empty wells across plates to exclude the occurrence of large-scale cross-contamination among samples during sequencing procedures: the minimum and maximum read counts were 2 and 234, respectively and the average and median reads counts were 37 and 18, respectively.

Paired 250-bp reads were trimmed of the initial five low-quality bases and further processed to generate the amplicon sequence variant, interchangeably called operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The data were subsampled at a depth of 22,704 and then normalized using the rarefaction on OTUs count at even depth. Taxonomic classification was performed utilizing 16S rRNA gene database from Silva classifier (silva-132-99-515-806-nb-classifier). The data were imported into R in a Biological Observation Matrix (biom) format, before further evaluation with Phyloseq (v.1.34.0).

This list has previously been curated and annotated by Poore et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> by manual review of the literature. This curation allowed the discrimination of taxa that are ‘likely contaminants’, ‘potentially pathological or commensal genera’ and ‘mixed evidence’ genera that have been described both as pathogens as well as contaminants.

Co-abundance analysis, which involves studying the presence of multiple components within a composition, can be difficult to perform accurately when using relative abundance.

To address this issue, techniques such as co-abundance network inference can be used to more accurately infer relationships between the components.</p>

We built a relaxed multivariable elastic-net OS Cox regression model using the glmnet R package (v.4.1.4) on the training set.

We used the concordance index as a performance metric. The parameters for which the mean cross-validation concordance index was the highest were selected as optimal hyper parameters. Next, the final model was built using these hyper parameters on the complete training set. To calculate risk scores in the training dataset (MBR scores), we passed the training set and best model to the ‘predict’ function. A total of 41 features (genera) were present in the best model with nonzero coefficients; we refer to these features as the ‘MBR classifier’, which represents the final model. A positive or negative coefficient of each genus of the MBR classifier can be binarized into ‘high-risk’ and ‘low-risk’ groups using the cutoff threshold of 0 and attributed to the strength of association with survival. A higher positive coefficient means high hazard risk of death, whereas a negative coefficient corresponds to lower risk of death.</p>

On the AC-ICAM246 (training set), all samples with MBR-high risk and/or in ICR-medium or ICR-low group are defined as mICRoScore low. The survival between patients with mICRoScore high and mICRoScore low was compared using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis and a log-rank test.</p>

            <p id="Par136">We used data from TCGA-COAD as external validation cohort to test the mICRoScore (testing set). The TCGA-COAD cohort includes 107 patients with both tumor microbiome data (downloaded from Dohlman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>) and RNA-seq data available (used for ICR estimation). ICR assignments from this cohort (see section TCGA data) were combined with the MBR classification to classify patients as mICRoScore high and mICRoScore low. The survival between patients with mICRoScore high and mICRoScore low was compared using a log-rank test.</p>

          <title>Sample size considerations</title>
          <p id="Par137">Sample size calculation is challenging in multi-omics studies due to the multitude of parameters that could be examined (implying the use of different tests from different platforms generating data with different data distribution) and empirical methods have been used by many consortia. Correlation between ICR and survival was declared as a primary objective in the research proposal submitted to the funding agency before any genomic data were generated, representing therefore a prospective–retrospective validation (JSREP07-010-3-005).</p>
          <p id="Par138">In the submitted proposal (2015), we planned to profile 400 tumors for gene expression analysis (samples from 456 patients were screened, samples from 391 patients were available for processing and samples from 348 patients retained after QC in the final cohort, see Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and at least 100 tumor–normal pairs for WES analysis (initially planned only for a subgroup of ICR-high versus -low tumors) and 100 for TCR sequencing using the immunoSEQ assay considering the high amount of DNA that is necessary (&gt;2 μg). Securing additional funds allowed us to perform WGS and 16S rRNA sequencing and to expand the WES and TCR analyses to any sample with sufficient DNA available. No specific power calculation was performed at that time and the targeted sample size was based on the estimated number of samples that could be retrieved from LUMC (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 400), which compared favorably with the sample size of similar studies in the field.</p>
          <p id="Par139">Regarding detection of somatic mutations and considering the overall somatic mutations frequency in colon cancer, 150 tumor exomes will give a power &gt;90% to detect a 10% mutational frequency in 90% of genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p id="Par140">Regarding survival analysis, in terms of ICR (the primary objective in the submitted proposal), for the comparison between ICR high versus ICR low, with 77 OS events detected, our study has a power &gt;80% for an HR of 0.5 with a two-sided α of 0.05. With 154 OS events in the whole cohort, our study has a power of 90% for an HR of 0.59 (assuming two group of equal size c) and a power of 90% for an HR of 0.57 (assuming groups with unequal sample size, 2:1) with a two-sided α of 0.05.</p>
