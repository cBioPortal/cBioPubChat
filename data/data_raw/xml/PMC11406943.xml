          <p id="Par1">The characterization of genetic alterations in tumor samples has become standard practice for many human cancers to achieve more precise disease classification and guide the selection of targeted therapies. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can serve as a source of tumor DNA in patients with central nervous system (CNS) cancer. We performed comprehensive profiling of CSF circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in 711 patients using an FDA-authorized platform (MSK-IMPACT™) in a hospital laboratory. We identified genetic alterations in 489/922 (53.0%) CSF samples with clinically documented CNS tumors. None of 85 CSF samples from patients without CNS tumors had detectable ctDNA. The distribution of clinically actionable somatic alterations was consistent with tumor-type specific alterations across the AACR GENIE cohort. Repeated CSF ctDNA examinations from the same patients identified clonal evolution and emergence of resistance mechanisms. ctDNA detection was associated with shortened overall survival following CSF collection. Next-generation sequencing of CSF, collected through a minimally invasive lumbar puncture in a routine hospital setting, provides clinically actionable cancer genotype information in a large fraction of patients with CNS tumors.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p id="Par2">Tumors affecting the central nervous system (CNS) are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that pose distinct challenges in diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. CNS metastases occur in up to 40% of cancer patients and confer poor prognosis. As strategies to treat systemic cancer have improved, the CNS frequently represents a site of late disease recurrence with molecular features that can differ from peripheral metastatic sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Primary CNS tumors represent an equally heterogenous group of neoplasms with considerable disease and treatment-related morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
        <p id="Par3">The characterization of genetic alterations in tumor samples has become standard practice for many human cancers to achieve more precise disease classification and guide the selection of targeted therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Genomic tumor profiling relies on the collection of tumor tissue which, in the case of CNS cancers, is obtained through a neurosurgical procedure. Several studies have demonstrated that circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with CNS cancer. In contrast, common plasma-based liquid biopsies are generally unsuccessful in detecting circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from CNS tumors, in part due to the blood–brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
        <p id="Par4">CSF-based liquid biopsies have shown feasibility and superiority for ctDNA detection in small-scale studies, demonstrating the presence of tumor derived genetic variants at high levels without the dilutional effect imparted by cell free DNA derived from the hematopoietic compartment in the peripheral circulation. However, the feasibility and utility of performing CSF ctDNA profiling in a routine hospital setting is currently unknown, as are the pre-analytic factors that may influence sequencing success. We previously reported a pilot study in 53 patients describing the potential utility of CSF ctDNA sequencing in CSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We subsequently validated this test for routine clinical use and demonstrated that profiling of CSF cfDNA is superior to profiling of CSF genomic DNA (gDNA) in capturing mutations at high variant allele frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Here we report our “real-world” experience using this clinically validated, FDA-authorized platform, MSK-IMPACT™, to routinely sequence ctDNA from over 1000 clinical CSF samples from patients with and without clinically documented CNS involvement by cancer.</p>

        <title>Materials and methods</title>
        <p id="Par5">The vast majority of clinical CSF samples were obtained by lumbar puncture and submitted for routine genomic profiling at the Diagnostic Molecular pathology laboratory to prospectively assess for relevant genomic alterations that could inform the diagnosis, classification or treatment of a suspected solid tumor involving the CNS were identified. For all patients, clinical charts were reviewed, when available. Calendar dates related to sample collection were recorded and the pathology reports were used to input patient diagnosis, when available. For each patient, any evidence of CNS involvement by other ancillary methods was collected. When available, molecular testing from prior samples sequenced in the laboratory were reviewed and correlated at the time of sign out.</p>
        <p id="Par6">All molecular laboratory procedures, volumes of samples received, extraction details, sequencing metrics and results were recorded, and electronic records were maintained in accordance to defined requirements for clinical testing.</p>
        <p id="Par7">This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Written informed consent for the use of genomic data for research (12–245 or 06–107 consents) was obtained for all patients; patients were not compensated for participation.</p>
        <sec id="Sec3">
          <title>CSF collection/delivery/storage</title>
          <p id="Par8">Per protocol, CSF samples were collected in Streck tubes, shipped and stored at room temperature. Samples were processed within 24 h of receipt, when feasible. Samples collected in sterile body fluid containers were occasionally accepted if internally collected and processed upon arrival to the extraction lab or immediately transferred to Streck tubes for subsequent processing.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Sec4">
          <title>cfDNA isolation</title>
          <p id="Par9">CSF was separated from its cellular constituents by double centrifugation (10 min at 1600 g and 10 min at 3000 g at 22 °C) to limit genomic DNA contamination. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was manually extracted from the supernatant using MagMax cfDNA Kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), according to manufacturer’s protocol and suspended in water in a 55 μL volume.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Sec5">
          <title>Assessment of cfDNA concentration and size distribution</title>
          <p id="Par10">Fragment analysis of cfDNA was performed using a High Sensitivity D1000 Screen Tape and corresponding reagents, which are loaded onto a 4200 Agilent Tape Station (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A 2 µL aliquot of extracted DNA per sample was analyzed to produce an electropherogram of the size distribution of the DNA fragments. Gating was then applied to assess the proportion of fragments within the cell free range of DNA (100–700 bp) and this compared with the total sample DNA (50–1000 bp) to estimate the percentage of cfDNA.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Sec6">
          <title>Sample sequencing and analysis</title>
          <p id="Par11">Genomic sequencing was performed using the MSK-IMPACT™ solid tumor assay, a custom hybridization capture-based panel targeting all coding regions of 468 (n = 274) or 505 (n = 733)) genes and select intronic regions for detection of point mutations, small insertion and deletions, relevant fusions and structural rearrangements and genome wide copy number changes. Testing using this assay was approved by the New York State Department of Health for clinical sequencing of genomic DNA (gDNA) from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor and other gDNA sources, as well as cfDNA isolated from CSF and is performed in our CLIA-compliant Molecular Diagnostics Service laboratory with processes detailed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Captured libraries of both cfDNA and gDNA isolated from blood (patient specific control) were sequenced as tumor:normal pairs on Illumina HiSeq 2500 or NovaSeq 6000 instruments and the data was analyzed according to established and published methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Point mutations and indels were detected using MuTect, Vardict and SomaticIndelDetector. SCNA were detected by comparing loess-normalized sequence coverage of targeted loci of the tumor with a standard diploid non-tumor sample. Structural variants (SV) were identified using DELLY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Variants were annotated using VEP/ ANNOVAR; variants that were considered germline or due to clonal hematopoiesis in the patient-matched blood normal sample were filtered out. All variants were reviewed and called by a bioinformatic analyst and a board-certified molecular genetic pathologist. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was calculated as mutations per megabase (Mb) utilizing only nonsynonymous coding mutations in the calculations (including frameshift, point mutations, and small insertions and deletions (indels)).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Sec7">
          <title>Determination of clinical actionability</title>
          <p id="Par12">Sequence mutations, copy number alterations, and rearrangements were annotated according to OncoKB, an FDA recognized human genetic variant database with curated content relating to the oncogenic effects and treatment implications of somatic alterations (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://oncokb.org">http://oncokb.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Briefly, mutations were annotated based on level of evidence that supports the use of an existing drug either as standard or care (levels 1 or 2), investigational (levels 3A and 3B) or hypothetical (level 4, denoting compelling evidence to support response to a drug). In addition, specific alterations may also be annotated as predictive of resistance to an FDA approved drug (R1) as standard or care or R2 denoting investigational resistance. Specific details may be obtained from the above website.</p>

          <title>Analysis of mutational signatures</title>
          <p id="Par13">Mutational signatures were analyzed as per the protocol utilized in Zehir et al<italic toggle="yes">. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In brief, we initially determined the tumor mutational burden for each CSF sample and ≥ 13.8 mutations/Mb was considered a sufficiently high TMB for signature analysis. Then, based on the pattern and context of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations across the targeted genome of CSF samples with elevated TMB, we sought to identify the most enriched signature per sample, according to the 30 mutational signatures described previously with a threshold set at 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>

        <sec id="Sec9">
          <title>MSK-ACCESS</title>
          <p id="Par14">cfDNA analysis from plasma was performed on a subset of cases using the MSK-ACCESS assay. This is a duplex barcoded, hybrid-capture sequencing panel, validated for detection of somatic alterations in plasma cfDNA and includes 129 key cancer-associated genes selected from the MSK-IMPACT assay. Details of the assay are further described in prior published work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Sec10">
          <title>Statistical analysis</title>
          <p id="Par15">Overall survival (OS) of patients was defined from the date of CSF collection until the date of death or the date of censoring, which was the most recently recorded visit at MSKCC if death was not recorded in the electronic medical record. For patients with multiple CSF samples, the first CSF sample was selected for analysis. Comparison of OS by variables of interest was performed using the Log-Rank test as well as with Cox proportional hazards regression modeling to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We compared the OS of patients with a clinically detectable genetic alteration in the CSF to patients without, followed by a breakdown by tumor type. Heterogeneity of the association of clinically detectable genetic alteration with OS by tumor type was formally tested with an interaction term.</p>
          <p id="Par16">For studying the associations between variables of interest and CSF ctDNA positivity in the lung cancer cohort, we used repeated measures generalized estimating equations with logit link and exchangeable covariance matrix. Univariable GEE models estimated odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). These analyses were performed in SAS v9.4 (Cary, NC). All other analyses, such as Kaplan–Meier survival analyses, Log-rank tests, and other modeling were performed using R v4.1.2 (The R Foundation). All statistical tests were two-sided with an alpha level of statistical significance set at &lt; 0.05.</p>

          <title>Patients</title>
          <p id="Par17">Between November 2018 and November 2022, we collected 1062 CSF samples from adult and pediatric patients seeking oncology care or molecular pathology consultation at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK); 55 CSF samples were excluded from further genomic profiling for logistic or administrative reasons. The final sequenced cohort included 1007 CSF samples from 711 patients (Supplementary Fig. 1a-b). We collected multiple CSF samples in 150/711 (21.1%) across their disease course (median: 2, range: 2–12 samples per patient) (Supplementary Fig. 1c). All CSF samples were processed and sequenced upon receipt in the clinical laboratory, in parallel with the corresponding matched normal (blood) sample.</p>
          <p id="Par18">Our patient cohort included patients with over 90 distinct tumor types of primary CNS and metastatic origin, including lung cancer (n = 188), breast cancer (n = 150) and gliomas (n = 148) as the most common broad categories (Supplementary Table 1). 85/1007 (8.5%) of the CSF samples were collected from patients who did not have any clinically documented evidence of CNS involvement by cancer. The median follow-up following CSF collection was 240 days (IQR: 112–483 days).</p>

          <title>Landscape of somatic genomic alterations detected in CSF</title>
          <p id="Par19">922/1007 (91.5%) CSF samples were collected from patients with clinical CNS disease; of these, 53% (489/922) harbored at least one somatic genetic alteration. These samples were categorized as ctDNA positive (ctDNA +).</p>
          <p id="Par20">By contrast, all samples collected from patients without any clinically documented CNS involvement by cancer (85/85) were negative for genetic alterations (specificity = 100%).</p>
          <p id="Par21">A total of 7110 somatic alterations (3944 somatic non-synonymous mutations, 2980 somatic copy number alterations, and 186 structural rearrangements) were detected across the 489 CSF ctDNA + samples. The number of mutations and variant allele frequencies (VAF) varied across ctDNA + samples, with a median of 4 mutations per sample (IQR: 2–8, range: 1–415) and VAFs ranging from 1 to 100% (median VAF: 38.7%, IQR: 23.2–51.1%). Tumor types varied by rates of ctDNA positivity, with GI cancers having the greatest proportion of CSF samples harboring at least one genetic alteration and embryonal tumors having the fewest. Likewise, VAF varied across the different tumor types with GI cancers having the greatest median VAF compared with other tumor types, possibly reflecting different rates of ctDNA shed across tumor types and the varying propensities for leptomeningeal versus parenchymal-only disease (Supplementary Fig. 2).</p>
          <p id="Par22">We observed the full spectrum of genetic alterations in CSF ctDNA. <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> was the most frequently altered gene across all tumor types (n = 242, 49% of 489 ctDNA + samples). Other commonly mutated genes were consistent with the expected landscapes of individual tumor types. For instance, both mutation and high amplification could be detected in <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MET</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> in lung cancer, as well as mutations in <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">STK11</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KEAP1</italic> and many others.

          <p id="Par25">To assess the clinical relevance of somatic variants in CSF, we annotated each of the alterations detected by their level of clinical actionability according to the OncoKB (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.oncokb.org/">https://www.oncokb.org/</ext-link>) precision oncology knowledge base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. OncoKB was recognized by the Food and Drug Administration as a tumor mutation database that provides information about the biological and clinical implications of over 5,000 cancer gene alterations. Level 1 alterations in OncoKB are defined as FDA-recognized biomarkers predictive of response to an FDA-approved drug in this indication. Level 2 alterations are standard care biomarkers recommended by the NCCN or other professional guidelines predictive of response to an FDA-approved drug in this indication. Level 3A alterations require compelling clinical evidence to support the biomarker as being predictive of response to a drug in this indication.</p>
          <p id="Par26">Across the 489 ctDNA + samples, 248 (50.7%) had a level 1 OncoKB actionable alteration. Lung carcinomas had the highest level 1 actionability in the cohort, consistent with the number of precision oncology drugs currently available in lung cancer. In this subset, we also detected the highest number of alterations predictive of therapeutic resistance (OncoKB R1 and R2) which informed further patient management. Among other malignancies, the OncoKB levels of actionability in the CSF were broadly comparable by cancer type to those found in tissues sequenced by MSK-IMPACT as part of the AACR GENIE cohort (n = 47,271) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a).<fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Clinical Relevance of CSF-ctDNA positivity. <bold>a</bold> Alterations detected in cfDNA from CSF were annotated and stratified by their level of clinical actionability according to the OncoKB precision oncology knowledge base.

          <p id="Par27">In addition to the assessment of therapeutic actionability, genomic profiles provided pivotal information for tumor subclassifications. For both primary and suspected metastatic lesions, profiling established clonal relatedness to a known malignancy and, in some cases, informed the presence of a previously unsuspected tumor (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4).</p>
          <p id="Par28">Notably, given the relative purity of ctDNA and the high number of genetic alterations that could be detected in some cases, the assessment of mutational signatures assisted in the determination or confirmation of the primary tumor site, such as UV signatures or smoking signatures in suspected metastatic cutaneous melanoma or lung adenocarcinoma, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5).</p>
          <p id="Par29">We determined the relationship between ctDNA positivity and overall survival (OS) in our cohort. Across all cancer types, detection of a genetic alteration in the CSF was associated with a three-fold increased risk of death (HR: 3.23, 95% CI: 2.58–4.05, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Median survival was 854 days shorter in patients with CSF positivity than otherwise (detected alteration: 235 days (95%CI: 177–272 days); undetected alteration: 1089 days (95%CI: 796 days-not reached) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) (Supplementary Table 2).

          <p id="Par30">Patients with lung cancer represented the largest subgroup of patients in our dataset and the subgroup of patients with the most FDA-approved genotype-directed therapies. This allowed a closer look into the role of CSF sampling as a tool for CNS assessment and disease monitoring.</p>
          <p id="Par31">Among the lung cancer patients those with parenchymal brain metastases and additional evidence of leptomeningeal involvement (defined by positive cytology, positive circulating tumor cells ≥ 3, or radiographic leptomeningeal spread as called by the formal clinical radiology report) were more likely to have positive CSF ctDNA than those with parenchymal brain metastases in the absence of leptomeningeal involvement (OR: 20.17; CI: 9.65–42.16; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (Supplementary Table 3, Additional File <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). After excluding cytology samples that were reported as atypical or suspicious by pathology (n = 33), detection of a genetic alteration in the CSF had greater sensitivity than positive cytology for the presence of leptomeningeal disease (sensitivity: 85.4% vs. 61.7%) and greater negative predictive value (80% vs. 66%). Since ctDNA positivity also occurred in some patients with parenchymal-only disease, this finding was not entirely specific for leptomeningeal disease (specificity: 78.7%, positive predictive value: 84.4%).</p>
          <p id="Par32">In lung cancer patients, the driver alterations initially detected in the tumor tissue were universally detected in the CSF (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a).

          <title>Comparison of CSF ctDNA with plasma and tumor tissue</title>
          <p id="Par34">Several patients in our cohort had undergone a tumor biopsy or plasma collection within 90 days of the CSF collection. This provided an opportunity to compare the representation of the cancer genome in CSF compared to tumor tissue or blood.</p>
          <p id="Par35">Correlations between somatic alterations in CSF ctDNA and tumor DNA were possible for 56 pairs (55 patients). Overall, we detected 999 alterations in tumor and CSF from these patients. 434/999 (43%) alterations were shared between tumor and CSF, 273/999 (27%) were private to the CSF and 292/999 (29%) were private to the tumor biopsy (Supplementary Fig. 8a). The frequency of shared CSF/tissue alterations was considerably higher (41/53 = 77%) than private alterations to CSF or tissue for the most clinically relevant alterations (OncoKB levels 1 to 3A) (Supplementary Fig. 8b). A comparison of VAFs for shared mutations revealed significantly higher levels in ctDNA from CSF (median VAF: 32%, IQR: 27%) compared to the tumor tissue (median VAF: 24%, IQR: 33%), despite routine enrichment by manual macro-dissection in solid tumor samples where necessary (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01, Mann–Whitney U test) (Supplementary Fig. 8c-d). Measurements of tumor mutation burden (TMB) in tumor tissue and CSF corresponded closely with each other (r = 0.81, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Spearman’s rank correlation) (Supplementary Fig. 8e.</p>

          <p id="Par38">While our standard recommendation for sample collection was 10 mL of CSF in Streck tubes, we received highly variable sample volumes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). The median CSF volume submitted was 5.5 mL (range 0.4–30 mL, IQR: 4.5 mL). Most samples (99.0%) were received in Streck BCT tubes; 1.0% arrived in sterile containers and were immediately transferred to Streck tubes in our lab; 99.2% of samples were processed within the established stability window of the Streck collection tubes (≤ 14 days). Delays in processing reflected lags in shipping and transport when samples were procured at outside hospitals; 45 samples (4.5%) were flagged due to deviations in quality control (received in non-Streck tubes, blood-tinged samples or frozen Streck tube collections).</p>
          <p id="Par39">In this cohort, delays in CSF DNA extraction did not adversely affect the rate of CSF ctDNA positivity (r = 0.27, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.29, Spearman’s rank correlation) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). However, the proportion of ctDNA in the samples decreased with increasing time to extraction (r = − 0.07, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.03, Spearman’s rank correlation) beyond 7 days, likely related to dilution associated with gDNA released from cells when CSF is not separated.

For these low volumes, samples from patients with CNS disease that were appropriately collected in Streck tubes were associated with rates of ctDNA positivity as low as 8.3% and 20.0% for primary and metastatic CNS tumors, respectively. The rate of positivity increased to 37.8% and 68.6% for primary and metastatic tumors, respectively, as volumes increased to 5 ml.

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p id="Par43">Our study reports on the clinical implementation of prospective CSF ctDNA sequencing for the assessment of CNS tumors. We identified genetic alterations in 53% of samples with known CNS involvement by cancer. In contrast, we did not detect CSF ctDNA in any of the patients without clinically documented evidence for CNS involvement by cancer. Our examination of over 1,000 CSF samples identified several scenarios where CSF ctDNA detection provides clinically actionable information. In CSF ctDNA-positive cases, the distribution of somatic alterations was consistent with the full spectrum of tumor-type specific alterations. Sequencing of CSF ctDNA identified genetic alterations associated with acquired resistance to molecularly targeted therapy, provided a reliable measure of tumor mutation burden (TMB), and identified mutations signatures associated with prior carcinogen exposure.</p>
        <p id="Par44">Patients with lung cancer represented the largest disease subgroup in our study. In this cohort of patients, we observed that patients with metastatic disease and leptomeningeal involvement were more likely to have positive CSF ctDNA than those with parenchymal brain metastases in the absence of leptomeningeal disease. We also observed that detection of ctDNA in CSF was associated with significantly shorter overall survival, suggesting that the detection of CSF ctDNA may be useful as supportive evidence of active CNS disease.</p>
        <p id="Par45">Analyses of contemporaneously collected CSF and plasma samples for a subset of patients in our study suggests that CSF “liquid biopsies” are more suitable for the monitoring of CNS cancer involvement than patient plasma. This conclusion is consistent with prior studies which have shown that plasma ctDNA testing has limited value in the context of primary brain tumors or metastatic lesions confined to the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Surprisingly, among the ctDNA positive CSF samples that were compared with contemporaneously collected tumor tissue, the VAFs across shared mutations was significantly higher in CSF, despite common practices of tumor enrichment of tissue samples by manual microdissection prior to sequencing. These findings highlight some of the unique qualities of CSF for genomic applications. CSF is a largely acellular fluid with virtually absent cell free DNA contributions from hematopoietic cells (compared to plasma) and very low DNA component from normal CNS cells. As such, in the context of CNS involvement with tumors shedding DNA into the CSF space, the DNA is tumor enriched and therefore genetic alterations are observed at very high variant allele frequencies. By contrast, tumor cells in tissue are frequently associated with other cells within the invaded organ and not amenable to enrichment by manual microdissection techniques.</p>
        <p id="Par46">We have identified pre-analytical factors that affected CSF ctDNA positivity, including the amount of CSF volume submitted for testing, ctDNA recovery and DNA sequencing coverage. While delays in CSF processing and improper collections did not necessarily affect our rate of positivity, they were associated with lower ctDNA component, which would impact the overall sensitivity of the assays. While these associations are not surprising, they raise important considerations for optimizing CSF collections. The use of more targeted assays with higher sensitivity may also be valuable, although sensitivity remains contingent on recovering sufficient quantity of cell free DNA for testing. For example, the use of digital PCR assays on pre-capture NGS libraries could be used to confirm key subthreshold variants that do not meet calling criteria with our established analysis pipelines.</p>
        <p id="Par47">In summary, our study provides a foundation for further improvements of CSF ctDNA assays and illustrates the feasibility and potential utility of incorporating CSF ctDNA profiling into the evaluation of patients with CNS cancer.</p>
