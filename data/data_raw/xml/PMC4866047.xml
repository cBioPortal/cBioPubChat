          <p>The genomic landscape of breast cancer is complex, and inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity are important challenges in treating the disease. In this study, we sequence 173 genes in 2,433 primary breast tumours that have copy number aberration (CNA), gene expression and long-term clinical follow-up data. We identify 40 mutation-driver (Mut-driver) genes, and determine associations between mutations, driver CNA profiles, clinical-pathological parameters and survival. We assess the clonal states of Mut-driver mutations, and estimate levels of intra-tumour heterogeneity using mutant-allele fractions. Associations between <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations and reduced survival are identified in three subgroups of ER-positive cancer (defined by amplification of 17q23, 11q13â€“14 or 8q24). High levels of intra-tumour heterogeneity are in general associated with a worse outcome, but highly aggressive tumours with 11q13â€“14 amplification have low levels of intra-tumour heterogeneity. These results emphasize the importance of genome-based stratification of breast cancer, and have important implications for designing therapeutic strategies.</p>

      <p>Human breast cancers are heterogeneous, and recent efforts have focused on characterizing both intra- and inter-tumour heterogeneity in a clinically relevant manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Current clinical management of the disease comprises morphological assessment (size, grade, lymph node status), and testing for oestrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). However, there is still much variation in the clinical outcomes of patients stratified based on these parameters. For instance, more than 75% of patients have ER+ breast cancers, but their outcomes and responses to therapy are extremely varied<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. This clinical heterogeneity may be explained by the diversity of genomic drivers that underlie the disease.</p>
      <p>To address this issue, we recently performed an integrated analysis of somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) and gene expression profiles in 2,000 primary tumours (METABRIC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. We observed that CNAs influencing expression in <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic> explained the greatest proportion of variance in gene expression, and were therefore likely to be enriched for driver genes. These driver CNAs were used in an unsupervised clustering approach to classify the tumours into 10 Integrative Clusters (IntClusts) that have distinctive copy number profiles and clinical courses. Readily identifiable driver genes include <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PAK1</italic> at 11q13â€“14 in IntClust2, <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> at 17q12 in IntClust5, <italic toggle="yes">ZNF703</italic> at 8p11 in IntClust6 and <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> at 8q24 in IntClust9. IntClust10 encompasses a group of genomically unstable (mostly triple-negative) tumours that express basal markers. IntClust4 comprises tumours with relatively few CNAs (CNA-devoid). The Cancer Genome Atlas's (TCGA) Pan-Cancer analyses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, which demonstrated that CNAs dominate the genomic landscape of breast cancer, support the biological relevance of a copy number-based classification. This novel driver-based molecular taxonomy has also been robustly validated in 7,500 tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although CNAs dominate the breast cancer genome, somatic SNVs and indels in driver genes are also important, and contribute to tumour biology. However, most breast cancer genes are somatically mutated at low frequencies and characterization of driver genes by high-throughput mutation profiling is consequently difficult when sample size is limited. This is exacerbated by stratification using clinical and molecular parameters. Large-scale efforts by the TCGA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> have contributed greatly towards enumerating breast cancer genes but analysis of clinical associations in these data sets is limited by the scarcity of long-term patient follow-up data and the stringent criteria used for sample selection (tumour size, malignant cellularity).</p>
      <p>We have now sequenced 173 of the most frequently mutated breast cancer genes in 2,433 primary tumours to both identify driver genes and understand their clinical significance. The 173 genes sequenced include those that harboured mutations in at least 2 samples in 5 large-scale sequencing studies published in 2012 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) and also some targeted by homozygous deletions (HDs) we previously identified<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Crucially, long-term follow-up data were available for the majority of the cohort (2,319 patients, median=115 months). Our results outline the mutation profiles of key breast cancer genes and the associations between genomic and clinical features. The large number of samples with clinical annotation allowed characterization of mutation patterns and intra-tumour heterogeneity within specific subsets of tumours, and identification of associations with patient outcome within these subgroups.</p>

          <title>The mutation landscape of 173 genes in 2,433 breast tumours</title>
          <p>We sequenced the exons of 173 genes (âˆ¼1.2â€‰Mbp) in 2,433 primary breast tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), reaching an average sequencing depth of at least 112 Ã— in 80% of samples (median=152 Ã— , <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Using a custom pipeline (Methods), we identified 32,476 somatic mutations, with 13,084 predicted to affect protein sequence. These coding mutations included 11,006 SNVs (10,193 missense, 808 nonsense, 5 read-through) and 1,635 small insertions or deletions (indels: 1,315 frameshift, 320 in-frame). We also detected 443 variants (268 SNVs, 175 indels) predicted to affect canonical splice sites. Each tumour had an average of 13 mutations (5 coding), with 131 tumours harbouring at least 30 mutations and 38 tumours devoid of any mutation (76 devoid of coding mutations). Details of mutations affecting all genes are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>.</p>
          <p>As previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> (coding mutations in 40.1% of the samples) and <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> (35.4%) dominated the mutation landscape. Only five other genes harboured coding mutations in at least 10% of the samples: <italic toggle="yes">MUC16</italic> (16.8%); <italic toggle="yes">AHNAK2</italic> (16.2%); <italic toggle="yes">SYNE1</italic> (12.0%); <italic toggle="yes">KMT2C</italic> (also known as <italic toggle="yes">MLL3;</italic> 11.4%) and <italic toggle="yes">GATA3</italic> (11.1%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">MUC16</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">AHNAK2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SYNE1</italic> are frequently mutated in several cancers (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org">http://www.cbioportal.org</ext-link><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), but their roles in tumorigenesis are as yet uncertain. <italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic> experiments have suggested a tumour-promoting role for <italic toggle="yes">MUC16</italic> in ovarian cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, but the gene also has a high background mutation rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p>
          <p>Predicted pathogenic germline mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>) in <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> were identified in 1.36% and 1.64% of the cohort, respectively, and 2.22% of tumours harboured pathogenic <italic toggle="yes">CHEK2</italic> germline mutations. <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> pathogenic germline mutations were found in 0.82% of the tumours.</p>

          <title>A ratiometric method identifies 40 Mut-driver genes</title>
          <p>Genes mutated in cancer comprise drivers, whose deregulation contributes directly to tumour progression, and passengers, which typically provide little or no selective advantage when mutated. To identify candidate driver genes, we used the scheme proposed by Vogelstein <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. This method is derived from the observed mutation patterns of well-characterized driver genes, and identifies candidate oncogenes and tumour suppressors based on the proportion of recurrent mutations (nonsynonymous SNVs, in-frame indels, oncogene score (ONC)) or inactivating mutations (frameshift indels, nonsense SNVs, splice site mutations, tumour suppressor gene score (TSG)) they harbour. In addition, we required that the candidates had a minimum of five recurrent or inactivating mutations. Exploration of a range of relevant thresholds demonstrated that the recommended cut-off of 20% was robust (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). As originally proposed, genes with an ONC score of at least 20% that also had a TSG score of at least 5% were classified as tumour suppressors, as oncogenes rarely harbour inactivating mutations. After stratifying by ER status, we identified 40 genes (22 in ER+ only, 3 in ERâˆ’ only, 15 shared) that are here on referred to as Mut-drivers genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). The spectra of mutations for the 40 genes are depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>. Only 6 out of 40 Mut-driver genes identified were oncogenes.</p>
          <p>The list of Mut-driver genes includes well-established breast cancer oncogenes and tumour suppressors such as <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, categorized as a tumour suppressor, had high ONC and TSG scores in both ER+ (ONC=42%, TSG=35%) and ERâˆ’ (ONC=45%, TSG=40%) tumours. The list also provides further evidence for the importance of other breast cancer genes that have more recently been reported. For example, <italic toggle="yes">TBX3</italic> had high TSG scores in ER+ (TSG=58%, 6.0% of ER+ samples with coding mutations) and ERâˆ’ (22%, 2.2%) tumours, and was also significantly mutated relative to the background mutation rate in the TCGA data set<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Inactivating mutations in the binding partners <italic toggle="yes">CBFB</italic> (ER+: TSG=66%, 6.0%; ERâˆ’: 50%, 0.32%) and <italic toggle="yes">RUNX1</italic> (also known as <italic toggle="yes">AML1</italic>; ER+: 59%, 3.7%; ERâˆ’: 53%, 2.4%) were also common. In addition, we observed recurrent K700E mutations in <italic toggle="yes">SF3B1</italic> (ER+: ONC=52%, 3.5%) which have recently been associated with differential splicing activity in breast tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. <italic toggle="yes">AGTR2</italic> harboured 6 P271L mutations (ER+: ONC=56%, 0.51%), and was also found to be mutated at a significant frequency in a recent study of 77 breast tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The presence of these genes in the Mut-driver list provides further support for their roles in breast cancer.</p>
          <p>We identified other Mut-driver genes that have not been formally associated with breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, but have been reported in other cancer types or in pan-cancer analyses. There were high proportions of inactivating mutations in the SWI/SNF complex members <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic> (ER+: TSG=45%, 5.2%; ERâˆ’: 18%, 3.3%) and <italic toggle="yes">PBRM1</italic> (ER+: TSG=3%, 1.6%; ERâˆ’: 25%, 2.5%). Overall, 22.6% of tumours harboured a coding mutation in one of the seven Mut-driver genes involved in chromatin function (<italic toggle="yes">KMT2C</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">NCOR1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CTCF</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KDM6A</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PRBM1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TBL1XR1</italic>). We also identified canonical activating mutations in members of the Ras pathway. <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> codon 12 mutations were present in 11 samples, and the gene had high ONC scores in both ER+ and ERâˆ’ cancers (ER+: 89%, 0.5%, ERâˆ’: 60%, 0.8%). We also observed mutations in <italic toggle="yes">HRAS</italic> at codons 61 and 12 (two and one samples, respectively), and a single <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> V600E mutation in an ERâˆ’ tumour, although the two genes did not meet Mut-driver criteria. These classical activating mutations are characteristic in other cancer types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and are actionable mutations in those settings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p>
          <p>The mutation patterns of some Mut-driver genes differed by ER status. For example, <italic toggle="yes">SMAD4</italic> was mutated in 1.2% of ER+ and 1.0% ERâˆ’ tumours, but had a high TSG score only in ER+ cases (ER+=35%, ERâˆ’=0%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">SMAD4</italic> expression has previously been linked with apoptosis in an ER+ context<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Similarly, <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> mutations were found in similar proportions in ER+ (2.8%) and ERâˆ’ tumours (3.2%), but there was a higher proportion of mutations at codon 755 in ER+ tumours (13 out of 53 ER+, 1 out of 22 ERâˆ’; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.05331, Fisher's exact test) and the gene had a higher ONC score than in the ERâˆ’ cohort (ER+: ONC=40%, ERâˆ’: ONC=12%). On the other hand, although <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> had a high ONC score in both ER+ (94%) and ERâˆ’ (81%) tumours, the domains in which the recurrent mutations occurred differed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). ER+ tumours had more <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations in codons 345 (62 out of 942 ER+, 2 out of 162 ERâˆ’; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.003396, Fisher's exact test) and codons 542 or 545 (helical domain; 259 out of 942 ER+, 32 out of 162 ERâˆ’; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.04245). In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations in codon 1047 (kinase domain) were more common in ERâˆ’ tumours (83 out of 162 ERâˆ’ versus 382 out of 942 ER+ <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.01243,).

          <title>HDs identify candidate tumour suppressor genes</title>
          <p>We previously reported several genes targeted by HDs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, and sequenced 40 of these to identify inactivating mutations (nonsense SNVs, frameshift indels, splice site mutations) and provide further evidence for their roles in breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Of the 40 genes, 8 were independently identified as Mut-driver tumour suppressor genes using the ratiometric method described above: <italic toggle="yes">FOXO3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CTNNA1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">FOXP1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MEN1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CHEK2</italic> in ER+ tumours; <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KDM6A</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MLLT4</italic> in both ER+ and ERâˆ’ tumours. These genes were not mutated at significant rates in the TCGA data set, possibly due to smaller sample size. <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> (also known as <italic toggle="yes">P16-INK4A)</italic> was the most common target of HDs (53 out of 2,087 tumours with copy number data). Although <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> mutations are relatively uncommon in breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, 6 of our tumours had inactivating mutations. <italic toggle="yes">FOXO3</italic> had 9 HDs and 14 inactivating mutations, and <italic toggle="yes">FOXP1</italic> had 3 HDs and 7 inactivating mutations. Low expression of these two genes has been previously linked with poor outcome in breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p>
          <p>We noted that <italic toggle="yes">CDH1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CTNNA1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MLLT4</italic> encode proteins that are involved in cell adhesion at adherens junctions. <italic toggle="yes">CDH1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MLLT4</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CTNNA1</italic> were deleted in 29, 7 and 1 tumours, respectively, and harboured inactivating mutations in 169, 20 and 4 tumours, respectively. E-cadherin, encoded by <italic toggle="yes">CDH1</italic>, is linked to the actin cytoskeleton by alpha-catenin (encoded by <italic toggle="yes">CTNNA1</italic>). Previous analyses have suggested that <italic toggle="yes">CTNNA1</italic> is a tumour suppressor gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, and it had a TSG score of 26% in ER+ tumours. <italic toggle="yes">MLLT4</italic> (TSG scores: ER+=20%, ERâˆ’=31%) encodes afadin, which forms a bridge between nectin and F-actin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. These mutation data strongly indicate that these functionally related genes are breast cancer tumour suppressors.</p>
          <p>Of the remaining 32 genes in the HD list, 30 harboured at least 1 inactivating mutation. Two of these genes were associated with immune function. <italic toggle="yes">JAK1</italic>, with 4 HDs, 4 inactivating mutations and 4 missense SNV/LOH events, has previously been linked with immune evasion in gynaecological tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. <italic toggle="yes">NT5E</italic>, which encodes CD73, has been linked with immune modulation and anthracycline response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, and had 3 HDs, 1 inactivating mutation and 4 missense SNV/LOH events in our data set.</p>

          <title>Associations with clinical and pathological parameters</title>
          <p>We used a multivariable logistic regression model (Methods) to identify associations between mutations in Mut-driver genes and clinical-pathological parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We focused only on functional mutations, which were defined as those that contributed towards a gene's ONC (recurrent mutations) or TSG (inactivating mutations) score for oncogenes or tumour suppressors, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). For <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, we used both recurrent and inactivating mutations.</p>
          <p>Functional mutations in <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> (odds ratio (OR)=0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.49â€“0.69), <italic toggle="yes">GATA3</italic> (OR=0.77, CI=0.6â€“0.99), <italic toggle="yes">MAP3K1</italic> (OR=0.52, CI=0.4â€“0.68)<italic toggle="yes">, KMT2C</italic> (OR=0.69, CI=0.52â€“0.94) and <italic toggle="yes">CBFB</italic> (OR=0.56, CI=0.38â€“0.83) were associated with lower grade in ER+ tumours. Inactivating mutations in <italic toggle="yes">GATA3</italic> (OR=0.63, CI=0.45â€“0.89) and <italic toggle="yes">CBFB</italic> (OR=0.48, CI=0.28â€“0.81) were more common in patients diagnosed at younger ages, whereas patients presenting with mutations in <italic toggle="yes">CDH1</italic> (OR=1.9, CI=1.2â€“3), <italic toggle="yes">KMT2C</italic> (OR=2.1, CI=1.3â€“3.6) and <italic toggle="yes">SF3B1</italic> (OR=4.5, CI=1.6â€“19) tended to be older. Mutations in <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> were associated with higher grade in both ER+ (OR=3.3, CI=2.6â€“4.2, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.001) and ERâˆ’ (OR=3.6, CI=2.1â€“6.2, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.001) tumours. Mutations in <italic toggle="yes">CDH1</italic> (OR=0.12, CI=0.034â€“0.38) and <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> (OR=0.16, CI=0.042â€“0.59) were uncommon in ERâˆ’ cancers, but were associated with lower grade.</p>
          <p>HER2 status is a key parameter in the clinical management of breast cancer. The TCGA previously noted that the mutation profiles of HER2+ tumours varied by ER status<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Similarly, we observed more functional mutations in <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> in HER2+/ERâˆ’ tumours (67.5%) than in HER2+/ER+ tumours (42.6%), and more functional mutations in <italic toggle="yes">GATA3</italic> in the HER2+/ER+ cohort (8.2%; HER2+/ERâˆ’=0.5%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). However, the prevalence of functional <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations was similar between the two groups (HER2+/ER+=29.5%, HER2+/ERâˆ’=30.1%), although there were significantly fewer <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations in HER2+/ER+ tumours than in HER2âˆ’/ER+ tumours (46.5%). <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations may have independent driver properties in a HER2+ context<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and have been implicated in resistance to anti-HER2 therapies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.</p>
          <p>The relative frequencies of functional mutations in tumours classified into five histological types are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>. Mucinous (8.3%) and medullary (8.8%) carcinomas had significantly fewer functional <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations relative to other subtypes (lobular=46.9%, mixed=50.0%, ductal=36.9%). Inactivating mutations in <italic toggle="yes">CDH1</italic> were observed in 52.6% of lobular carcinomas, and <italic toggle="yes">CDH1</italic> was also the most frequently mutated gene in lobular carcinomas in the TCGA data set<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Loss of E-cadherin function is a hallmark of invasive lobular carcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Only 3.4% of ductal/NST carcinomas had inactivating <italic toggle="yes">CDH1</italic> mutations. HD of <italic toggle="yes">CDH1</italic> was observed in 18 ductal/NST carcinomas (1.1%) and in 4 lobular carcinomas (2.1%).

          <title>Associations between somatic alterations</title>
          <p>To explore patterns of co-mutation and mutual exclusivity, we examined pairwise associations between somatic events using Fisher's exact test. Significant pairwise interactions (false discovery rate (FDR)=0.1) between functional mutations in Mut-driver genes are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>. Mutual exclusivity between mutations in <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic> (OR=0.017, CI=0.00044â€“0.1), between <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3R1</italic> (OR=0.092, CI=0.0022â€“0.59), and between <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">FOXO3</italic> (OR=0.1, CI=0.0025â€“0.68) reflect functional redundancy within the Akt signalling pathway. Surprisingly, 15 out of 57 tumours harbouring <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> inactivating mutations also had recurrent <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations. Three out of 18 tumours with <italic toggle="yes">PIK3R1</italic> functional mutations also had <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> mutations. Overall, 45.2% of all tumours had a functional mutation in at least one member of the Akt signalling pathway (<italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3R1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">FOXO3</italic>).

Co-mutation of <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> (OR=5.3, CI=2.2â€“14) is common in triple-negative cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.

          <p>We also explored associations between mutations and recurrent CNAs identified by GISTIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Most tumour suppressor genes displayed classic mutation/LOH associations, including <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> and 10q23.1 deletion (OR=3.4; 95% CI=1.7â€“6.6), and <italic toggle="yes">GPS2</italic> and 17p13.1 deletion (OR=7.1; CI=2.3â€“29). Positive associations were also observed between genes more frequently mutated in ER+ breast cancer and concurrent 1q gain/16q loss (probably due to t(1q;16p) translocation). These associations are particularly strong for mutations in <italic toggle="yes">CDH1</italic> (OR=2, CI=1.4â€“3.1) and <italic toggle="yes">CBFB</italic> (OR=5, CI=2.3â€“12), both of which reside at the 16q22 locus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.

          <title>Landscape of Mut-driver mutations across the IntClusts</title>
          <p>The mutation and copy number landscapes of the 40 Mut-driver genes across the IntClusts are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>. The number of mutations in Mut-driver genes in individual tumours was similar across IntClusts, but the relative frequencies of gene mutations varied significantly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 8 and 9</xref>). For example, <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> has functional mutations in 84.6% of IntClust10, 64.2% of IntClust5, 50.5% of IntClust4-, and 44.7% and 40.7% of IntClusts9 and 6, respectively, both of which largely comprise ER+ tumours. In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations occurred in only 10.0% of IntClust3, 14.0% of IntClust7 and 4.4% of IntClust8, which are subtypes composed almost exclusively of ER+ good prognosis tumours. IntClust1 (29.0%), IntClust2 (24.1%) and IntClust4+ (21.1%) had intermediate frequencies of functional <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations.</p>
          <p>To formally identify interactions between IntClust and driver mutations, we looked for Mut-driver genes that were mutated in significantly higher or lower proportions of tumours in at least one IntClust relative to the remaining samples. This analysis identified nine genes at FDR=0.01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Mutations in <italic toggle="yes">CBFB</italic> (3.3% across all tumours) were more frequent in IntClust3 (7.8%) and IntClust8 (9.7%), and less common in IntClust7 (1.0%), although patients within all these subtypes have relatively good outcomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10a</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">GATA3</italic> mutations (8.9% across all tumours) were more frequent in IntClust1 (20.0%) and IntClust8 (19.5%), although patients in IntClust1 have worse outcomes.</p>
          <p>One of the key features of the IntClust classification is stratification of ER+ tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). We therefore explored the distributions of mutations in Mut-driver genes in the ER+ subsets of the IntClusts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). There was a high prevalence of functional <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations in ER+ tumours belonging to IntClust10 (59.3 versus 18.7% in all ER+ tumours). The CNA profiles of the 27 IntClust10+ are more similar to triple-negative basal-like cancers than to ER+ breast cancers.</p>
          <p>Finally, we grouped the 40 Mut-driver genes into pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>), and scored the tumours as pathway-altered if at least 1 of the genes in the pathway was affected by mutation or CNA. IntClusts 3 and 7 comprise tumours with similar clinical characteristics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>), but IntClust7 had a higher frequency of alterations in the MAP kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway (IntClust3=20.5%, IntClust7=24.6%), and there were more alterations in tissue organization genes in IntClust3 (IntClust3=24.0%, IntClust7=10.6%). IntClust1 had fewer alterations in the Akt signalling pathway (30.5%), despite comprising mostly ER+ tumours. Alterations in DNA damage response genes were present in 89.9% of IntClust10 (mostly triple-negative, basal-like) tumours, and were also frequent in IntClust9 tumours (mostly ER+ and poor prognosis; 52.3%). Tumours in IntClust10 also had more alterations in cell cycle regulation (20.2%) and ubiquitination (6.7%) genes, but had fewer alterations in the Akt signalling pathway (27.7%).</p>

          <title>Clonal states of Mut-driver genes</title>
          <p>To characterize the clonal states of Mut-driver gene mutations across the IntClusts, we used variant allele fractions (VAF) and copy number data to obtain estimates of the fraction of cancer cells harbouring mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 13â€“15</xref>). The distributions of the cancer cell fractions (CCFs) of functional mutations in the Mut-driver genes were centred largely around 1, indicating their presence in nearly all tumour cells and likely early occurrence in tumour evolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). However, differences between IntClusts were apparent. In general, tumours in IntClusts constituted by patients with better prognosis (IntClusts 3, 7, 8) had lower proportions of clonal mutations in driver genes relative to IntClusts with patients with worse outcomes (IntClusts 2, 10) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). Nearly all activating <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations in IntClusts10 (median CCF=1, interquartile range (IQR)=1â€“1, 26 mutations) and IntClust9 (median=1, IQR=0.98â€“1, 49 mutations) were present at CCFs close to 1, whereas some <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations in IntClust3 tumours were present in lower CCFs (median=0.96, IQR=0.75â€“1, 215 mutations). IntClusts 2 and 6 are relatively small subgroups comprising ER+ cancers with poor outcome, but <italic toggle="yes">MAP3K1</italic> mutations in IntClust2 (median=1, IQR=0.91â€“1, seven mutations) were present in higher CCFs than in IntClust6 (median=0.90, IQR=0.69â€“0.99, six mutations).</p>
          <p>Characteristic examples are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>, which shows the probability distributions of mutation CCFs in individual tumours. MTS-T1775 (IntClust4+) has a clonal <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutation (CCF=1, CI=1â€“1) and a <italic toggle="yes">CDH1</italic> inactivating mutation present in a lower CCF (0.64; CI=0.39â€“1). This pattern appears to be characteristic of IntClust4+ tumours, which frequently appear to harbour more subclonal <italic toggle="yes">CDH1</italic> mutations than those in IntClusts 3, 7 and 8. MTS-T1719 (IntClust9) has a clonal inactivating <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic> mutation (CCF=0.93, CI=0.77â€“1) and a subclonal inactivating <italic toggle="yes">GATA3</italic> mutation (0.69, CI=0.53â€“0.88). MTS-T1226 (IntClust3) has three functional mutations: a clonal <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutation (CCF=0.67, CI=0.38â€“1), a clonal inactivating <italic toggle="yes">MAP3K1</italic> mutation (CCF=0.99, CI=0.73â€“1) and a subclonal inactivating <italic toggle="yes">MAP3K1</italic> mutation (CCF=0.60, CI=0.41â€“0.85). The presence of two <italic toggle="yes">MAP3K1</italic> mutations in this instance suggests biallelic <italic toggle="yes">MAP3K1</italic> inactivation in a subset of cells.

          <title>Prognostic associations of mutations in Mut-driver genes</title>
          <p>To analyze the associations between functional mutations in Mut-driver genes and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), we constructed multivariable Cox proportional hazards models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>) for ER+ and ERâˆ’ tumours separately, taking into account the effects of patient age, tumour grade, size and lymph node status <italic toggle="yes">(Methods)</italic>. In ER+ tumours, mutations in both <italic toggle="yes">MAP3K1</italic> (hazard ratio (HR)=0.56, CI=0.38â€“0.82) and <italic toggle="yes">GATA3</italic> (HR=0.58, CI=0.4â€“0.82) were associated with longer survival. Despite being uncommon, inactivating mutations in <italic toggle="yes">SMAD4</italic> (HR=3.4, CI=1.4â€“8.3) and <italic toggle="yes">USP9X</italic> (HR=3, CI=1.2â€“7.2) were associated with worse BCSS. Low levels of nuclear Smad4 and deregulation of other components of the TGF-beta signalling pathway have been associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. We also observed that inactivating mutations in <italic toggle="yes">NF1</italic> were associated with shorter BCSS in ERâˆ’ tumours (HR=2.7, CI=1.3â€“5.5).</p>
          <p><italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations were associated with worse outcome in ER+ (HR=1.6, CI=1.3â€“2, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.0001), but not in ERâˆ’ disease (HR=1.1, CI=0.8â€“1.6). Mutations in the DNA-binding domain were associated with the worst outcomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 16</xref>). Conversely, mutations in <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> were prognostic in patients with ERâˆ’ tumours (HR=1.4, CI=1.1â€“1.9), but not in those with ER+ tumours (HR=1.1, CI=0.9â€“1.3). The association with worse survival in ERâˆ’ patients was present for <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations in both the helical and kinase domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 17</xref>). The number of mutations in Mut-driver genes was not associated with BCSS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 18</xref>).</p>
          <p>We hypothesized that the prognostic effects of mutations may be influenced by the CNA background. We therefore analyzed the associations between mutations and BCSS after stratifying tumours by IntClust. We tested <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations in ER+ cancers as a prototypical example, as previous studies reported contradictory results on the prognostic relevance of <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations in ER+ tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. There was no association between mutation domain or mutation CCF and BCSS, and we did not observe differences in patient outcome after stratification by HER2 status (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 19</xref>). We constructed univariable Cox models with an interaction term to analyze the effects of <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations within each IntClust (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). This interaction term provides an indication of whether the presence of mutations within a specific IntClust has an association with BCSS over and beyond the associations of BCSS with IntClust membership or <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations in the entire ER+ cohort. Significant interactions were identified in IntClusts1+, 2+ and 9+, suggesting that <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations in these specific groups were associated with poor outcome.

          <title>Intra-tumour heterogeneity across the IntClusts</title>
          <p>To quantify intra-tumour heterogeneity, we used the previously established mutant-allele tumour heterogeneity (MATH) score<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, which is based on the variation in VAFs of all mutations in a tumour (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). We excluded samples with fewer than five somatic mutations from this analysis, and computed the MATH scores for the ER+ and ERâˆ’ tumours separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). ER+ tumours generally had lower MATH scores (median=0.29, IQR=0.18â€“0.44) than ERâˆ’ tumours (median=0.41, IQR=0.25â€“0.56). Higher MATH scores were associated with worse outcome in ER+ cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>).</p>
          <p>The relationship between intra-tumour heterogeneity and chromosomal instability (CIN; defined as the percentage of the genome affected by CNAs) across the IntClusts is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>. Tumours within IntClust10 had the highest MATH scores (median=0.47, IQR=0.31â€“0.61). Although IntClusts 4- and 10 both comprise triple-negative basal-like tumours, tumours in IntClust4-, which have high levels of lymphocytic infiltration, had low MATH scores (median=0.27, IQR=0.19â€“0.54). Tumours belonging to the IntClusts with the best outcomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10a</xref>) had low scores (IntClust3: median=0.29, IQR=0.17â€“0.45; IntClust7: median=0.27, IQR=0.29â€“0.40; IntClust8: median=0.28, IQR=0.18â€“0.39). Patients within IntClusts 1 (median=0.37, IQR=0.26â€“0.53), 6 (median=0.35, IQR=0.21â€“0.48) and 9 (median=0.41, IQR=0.25â€“0.58) have poor outcomes, and their tumours had intermediate MATH scores. Surprisingly, tumours in IntClust2 had low MATH scores (median=0.25, IQR=0.16â€“0.37) despite patients in this subgroup having poor outcomes. The 11q13â€“14 amplicon (two gene cassettes centred around <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PAK1</italic>, respectively) is a key driver CNA in IntClust2, and may be responsible for the poor clinical trajectories of patients within this group.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>Understanding the clinical implications of driver mutations in breast cancer has been hindered by small sample sizes and lack of long-term clinical follow-up. The large data set reported here indicates that patient classification into clinically relevant subtypes requires profiling both gene mutations (by sequencing) and stratification based on CNAs, which dominate the genomic landscape. The results (available at www.cbioportal.org) represent an important resource characterizing the combined genomic profiles of a large number of primary breast tumours from patients with long-term follow-up data.</p>
        <p>A key aim of precision cancer medicine is to tailor clinical management based on the specific events that are relevant to tumour development and progression. To this end, it is important to comprehensively catalogue the drivers for a particular cancer, and to also determine the contexts that define their relevance. We used a ratiometric method to identify 40 Mut-driver genes, and noted that ER stratification revealed differences in the oncogenic properties of some genes, including <italic toggle="yes">SMAD4</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic>. Novel genes on the Mut-driver list include <italic toggle="yes">FOXO3</italic>, a transcription factor regulated by Akt signalling, and <italic toggle="yes">AGTR2</italic>, which may be a therapeutic target<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. The ratiometric method identified Mut-drivers in breast cancers that were previously known drivers in other cancer types (such as <italic toggle="yes">KRAS, ARID1A</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PBRM1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KDM6A</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MEN1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">FOXP1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">USP9X</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">BAP1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SMAD4</italic>). This raises the possibility that therapies used in other clinical settings may be applicable to breast cancers with mutations in these genes. For example, mutations in the SWI/SNF components <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PBRM1</italic> are especially prevalent in bladder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> and renal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> cancers, and tumours harbouring these mutations may have dependencies on other SWI/SNF components that can be therapeutically exploited<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Previous work has shown that disruption of <italic toggle="yes">ARID1B</italic> function in an <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic>-deficient context inhibits proliferation in a number of cancer cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>.</p>
        <p>The degree of inter-tumour heterogeneity present in breast cancer, and ER+ disease in particular, at the genomic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, transcriptomic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> and clinical<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> levels has long been recognized. The IntClust stratification of ER+ tumours into groups with specific CNAs and distinct prognostic courses has been robustly validated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Here we provide further biological insight into this inter-tumour heterogeneity by overlaying the mutation frequencies of 40 breast cancer Mut-driver genes, and by characterizing their clonal states. For example, <italic toggle="yes">KMT2C</italic> mutations are infrequent and usually subclonal in IntClust1, but more common and usually clonal in IntClust8. IntClust10 ER+ tumours had a relatively high prevalence of <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations. This observation supports the CNA-based IntClust classification of some ER+ cancers into a subtype containing mostly triple-negative basal-like tumours.</p>
        <p>The observation that <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations have distinct prognostic associations in ER+ tumours stratified into IntClusts is a key novel finding. Recent reports of mouse models have demonstrated that the same <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutation can result in different tumour phenotypes depending on cellular background<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>, and our results may similarly be due to the specific biological properties of tumours within specific IntClusts. While confirmation in further studies is required, these results provide compelling evidence for genome-based stratification in future therapeutic trials of PI3K inhibitors.</p>
        <p>The success of targeted therapies, however, will depend on overcoming the problem of resistance, which may occur earlier in tumours with more clonal diversity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. We used the MATH score as a measure of intra-tumour heterogeneity and observed that higher MATH scores were associated with reduced survival in ER+ tumours. However, tumours belonging to IntClust2, which comprises patients with poor outcome, have low levels of intra-tumour heterogeneity and CIN. These tumours are characterized by co-amplification of <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PAK1</italic> at 11q13â€“14, and have previously been shown to be resistant to neo-adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. These observations will need to be externally validated, and should be taken forward to develop better strategies to manage patients whose tumours belong to this small but highly aggressive subgroup.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, combining copy number, gene expression and mutation profiles provides a richer understanding of the genomic landscape of breast cancer, and offers new insights into inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity that should inform the future development of clinical management of patients.</p>

          <title>Sample collection</title>
          <p>We sequenced a total of 2,433 primary tumours and 650 normal non-cancerous samples comprising normal adjacent breast tissue (523) or peripheral blood cells (127). Overall, there were 548 matched tumour/normal pairs present in our data set. We also sequenced replicates for 221 primary tumours, as well as a number of commonly used breast cancer cell lines.</p>
          <p>All samples were obtained with the consent from patients and appropriate approval from ethical committees (REC ref 07/H0308/161; REC ref 12/EE/0484; REC ref 07/Q0106/63). Detailed information about tissue collection for each cohort can be found in their respective publications: METABRIC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, NeoTango<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>, Nottingham<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref> and DETECT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>.

          <title>Histological classification and ER status</title>
          <p>Information on lymph node status, stage and tumour size was available from original histopathology reports for all studies. Expert breast cancer pathologists reviewed FFPE sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) from tumours with available material and scored histological tumour type, grade, tumour cellularity and lymphocytic infiltration.</p>
          <p>Immunohistochemistry-based (IHC) scoring of ER status was, where available, used to classify ERâˆ’positive (ER+) and ERâˆ’negative (ERâˆ’) tumours. To confirm this classification for samples which had gene expression data available, we fit a two-component Gaussian mixture model to the expression levels of <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic> using the mixtools package<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref> in R, and computed the probabilities of the samples belonging to the two distributions defined by the components. The distribution yielding the higher probability was selected to represent the ER status for each sample. Where the calls between the two systems differed, we used the expression-derived classification if the probability of belonging to the opposite distribution was at least 5 Ã— higher than for the distribution described by IHC; this scheme was chosen so as to assign more weight to the IHC classification, as this is currently the clinical gold standard. We performed a similar analysis with <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> expression levels to corroborate the IHC-based HER2 calls. For patients without expression data (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=416), we used the IHC scores to assign ER and HER2 status. Similarly, gene expression-based classification was used for samples without IHC data.</p>

          <p>DNA was quantified using Qubit HS dsDNA assay (Life Technologies, CA) and libraries were prepared from a total of 50â€‰ng of DNA using Illumina's Nextera Custom Target Enrichment kit (Illumina, CA). In brief, a modified Tn5 transposase was used to simultaneously fragment DNA and attach a transposon sequence to both end of the fragments generated. This was followed by a limited cycle PCR amplification (11 cycles) using barcoded oligonucleotides that have primer sites on the transposon sequence generating 96 uniquely barcoded libraries per run. The libraries were then diluted and quantified using Qubit HS dsDNA assay.</p>
          <p>Five hundred nanograms from each library were pooled into a capture pool of 12 samples. Enrichment probes (80-mer) were designed and synthesized by Illumina; these probes were designed to enrich for all exons of the target genes, as well for 500â€‰bp up- and downstream of the gene. The capture was performed twice to increase the specificity of the enrichment. Enriched libraries were amplified using universal primers in a limited cycle PCR (11 cycles). The quality of the libraries was assessed using Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies, CA) and quantified using KAPA Library Quantification Kits (Kapa Biosystems, MA).</p>
          <p>Products from four capture reactions (that is, 48 samples) were pooled for sequencing in a lane of Illumina HiSeq 2,000. Sequencing (paired-end, 100â€‰bp) of samples and demultiplexing of libraries was performed by Illumina (Great Chesterford, UK).</p>

Custom scripts were written to identify variants affecting splice sites using exon coordinates provided by Ensembl. Indels were referenced by the first codon they affected irrespective of length; for example, insertions of two bases and five bases at the same codon were classed together.</p>
          <p>To obtain the final set of mutation calls, we used a two-step approach, first removing any spurious variant calls arising as a consequence of sequencing artefacts (generic filtering) and then making use of our normal samples and the existing data to identify somatic mutations (somatic filtering). For both levels of filtering, we used hard thresholds that were obtained, wherever possible, from the data itself. For example, some of our filtering parameters were derived from considering mutations in technical replicates (15 samples sequenced in triplicate)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>. We compared the distributions of key parameters (including quality scores, depth, VAF) for concordant (present in all three replicates) and discordant (present in only one out of three replicates) variants to obtain thresholds, and used ROC analysis to select the parameters that best identified concordant variants.</p>

          <title>Survival analyses</title>
          <p>Univariable or multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between mutations and survival. BCSS was used as the endpoint. Patients with deaths due to other or unknown causes were censored at the date of death, and all other patients were censored at the date of last contact. For the multivariable models, we included as variables: grade size (greater or less than 50â€‰mm), lymph node status (positive or negative) and age (greater or less than 55). This coding scheme was chosen taking into consideration the minimum level of data available across the cohorts in the study. The same scheme was used when performing logistic regression for identifying associations between clinical parameters and mutation presence. To identify associations between events, we used Fisher's exact test for 2 Ã— 2 contingency tables.</p>

          <title>Driver gene identification</title>
          <p>To identify genes that may be relevant to breast cancer, we looked for those that harboured multiple recurrent or inactivating mutations, as these are mutation patterns typical of oncogenes and tumour suppressors. Recurrent mutations were defined as missense SNVs and in-frame substitutions that affected the same codon of the annotation transcript, whereas inactivating mutations included nonsense SNVs, frameshift substitutions and variants that affected splice sites. The proportions of recurrent (ONC) and inactivating (TSG) mutations for each gene (out of the total number of mutations) were computed, and a threshold of 0.2 was used (20/20 rule). Genes with an ONC score &gt;0.2 and with a TSG score &gt;0.05 were classified as tumour suppressors. A minimum of five recurrent or inactivating mutations was required for a gene to be selected as putative drivers. The method was adapted from the study by Vogelstein <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref></p>

          <title>Clonal states of Mut-driver mutations</title>
          <p>To infer the CCFs in which the observed mutations occurred, we used VAFs, and copy number data and tumour purity estimates as obtained from ASCAT. The CCF was defined as in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>:</p>
          <p>
            <disp-formula id="eq1">

            </disp-formula>
          </p>
          <p>where <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> is the tumour purity estimate, and CN<sub>norm</sub> and CN<sub>tum</sub> refer to the normal (that is, 2) and tumour copy number states, respectively. We used the â€˜binconf' function in the R package Hmisc (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Hmisc">http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Hmisc</ext-link>) to obtain an estimate and CI for the VAF given the depth and the number of reads harbouring the mutant allele at the mutant locus.</p>
          <p>To identify â€˜clonal' (present in the entire tumour) or â€˜subclonal' (present in only a subset of tumour cells) mutations, we computed 95% CIs for each CCF estimate based on the VAF and depth of coverage at the mutation loci. Mutations were labelled as â€˜subclonal' if their CCF CIs did not overlap 1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>).</p>

          <title>Intra-tumour heterogeneity</title>
          <p>To quantify the level of intra-tumour heterogeneity present in a sample, we used the MATH measure described in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>:</p>
