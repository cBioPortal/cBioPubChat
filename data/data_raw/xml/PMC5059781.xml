        <abstract>
          <p>Renal cell carcinomas with unclassified histology (uRCC) constitute a significant portion of aggressive non-clear cell renal cell carcinomas that have no standard therapy. The oncogenic drivers in these tumours are unknown. Here we perform a molecular analysis of 62 high-grade primary uRCC, incorporating targeted cancer gene sequencing, RNA sequencing, single-nucleotide polymorphism array, fluorescence <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> hybridization, immunohistochemistry and cell-based assays. We identify recurrent somatic mutations in 29 genes, including <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic> (18%), <italic toggle="yes">SETD2</italic> (18%), <italic toggle="yes">BAP1</italic> (13%), <italic toggle="yes">KMT2C</italic> (10%) and <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> (8%). Integrated analysis reveals a subset of 26% uRCC characterized by NF2 loss, dysregulated Hippoâ€“YAP pathway and worse survival, whereas 21% uRCC with mutations of <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TSC1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TSC2</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> and hyperactive mTORC1 signalling are associated with better clinical outcome. FH deficiency (6%), chromatin/DNA damage regulator mutations (21%) and ALK translocation (2%) distinguish additional cases. Altogether, this study reveals distinct molecular subsets for 76% of our uRCC cohort, which could have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.</p>

      <p>Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) encompasses a heterogeneous group of tumours and is mainly categorized based on unique histopathological features. Major subtypes are clear cell RCC (ccRCC, âˆ¼75%), papillary RCC (pRCC, âˆ¼15%) and chromophobe RCC (chRCC, âˆ¼5%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. uRCC accounts for 4â€“5% of RCC that is not classifiable as one of the major (&gt;5%) or the rare (&lt;1%) subtypes such as medullary, collecting duct, mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma, and MiTF family translocation RCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. uRCC represents a large proportion of metastatic RCC that exhibits non-clear cell histology (nccRCC), has no standard therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, and presents formidable diagnostic and management challenges<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Large collaborative genomic efforts, including The Cancer Genome Atlas projects, have greatly extended our molecular understanding of common RCC subtypes, including ccRCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, chRCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> and pRCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. However, as a rare and heterogenous group of tumours, uRCC currently remains as the largest molecularly uncharacterized RCC category with unknown oncogenic pathways.</p>
      <p>To gain knowledge towards this unmet need in the diagnosis and management of aggressive nccRCC, we conducted the first in-depth molecular characterization of uRCC in a cohort of 62 primary tumours with high-grade histologic features, all of which were re-reviewed by experienced genitourinary pathologists to ensure their proper classification based on the current World Health Organization and International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus diagnostic criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. To study the spectrum of this heterogeneous group of tumours and not to exclude cases with only formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archival tissue, we employ an integrated and step-wise approach, combining targeted cancer gene sequencing, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, fluorescence <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH), immunohistochemistry and cell-based assays to focus on identifying molecular alterations and pathways that are potentially clinically informative. We find recurrent somatic mutations in 29 genes, and identify distinct molecular subsets that are characterized by NF2 loss, hyperactive mTORC1 signalling, FH deficiency, chromatin/DNA damage regulator mutations or ALK translocation and associated with varying clinical outcomes.</p>

          <title>Mutation landscape of uRCC by targeted gene sequencing</title>
          <p>The clinicopathologic features and outcomes of this 62-patient uRCC cohort are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. At the time of nephrectomy, 58% of cases were locally advanced (pT3 and above), with 32% showing regional lymph node involvement. Overall, 42% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=26) of patients developed metastatic disease and 35% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=22) died of RCC, underscoring the aggressive clinical behaviour and poor response to systemic therapies observed in this uRCC cohort.</p>
          <p>To investigate the molecular aberrations in uRCC, we first employed the Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (IMPACT) assay, a customized ultra-deep targeted next-generation sequencing platform designed to capture all exons and selected introns of 230 oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes, and members of pathways deemed actionable by targeted therapies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. We identified 29 recurrently mutated genes with an average of 2.6 (0â€“8) protein-coding somatic mutations per patient tumour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic> (18%), <italic toggle="yes">SETD2</italic> (18%) and <italic toggle="yes">BAP1</italic> (13%) were the three most frequently mutated genes. The incidence of <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic> mutations in our cohort is markedly higher than what is reported in ccRCC (0â€“1%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, pRCC (0â€“6%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and chRCC (0%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In ccRCC, <italic toggle="yes">VHL</italic> mutations occur at âˆ¼75%, and <italic toggle="yes">SETD2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BAP1</italic> at 10â€“20% frequencies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, whereas in our uRCC cohort, only a single <italic toggle="yes">VHL</italic> mutation was detected in one case (T08). There were 13 genes mutated at 5â€“10%, among which 5 are epigenetic regulators: <italic toggle="yes">KMT2C</italic> (10%), <italic toggle="yes">KMT2D</italic> (5%), <italic toggle="yes">ATRX</italic> (7%), <italic toggle="yes">DNMT3A</italic> (5%) and <italic toggle="yes">SMARCB1</italic> (5%); 4 are mTORC1 pathway regulators: <italic toggle="yes">mTOR</italic> (8%), <italic toggle="yes">TSC1</italic> (7%), <italic toggle="yes">TSC2</italic> (5%) and <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> (7%); and 3 are transcription factors: <italic toggle="yes">KLF6</italic> (5%), <italic toggle="yes">NOTCH2</italic> (5%) and <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> (5%).

          <title>uRCC with NF2 loss and dysregulated Hippoâ€“YAP signalling</title>
          <p>The enrichment of cases with <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic> mutations (11 of 62) discovered in our uRCC cohort suggests that NF2 loss could potentially define a molecular subset of uRCC. To assess the NF2 status in uRCC beyond mutations, we next assessed the status of chromosome 22q12 where <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic> resides. Based on copy-number plots generated by the IMPACT sequencing, 22q12 loss was evident in 14 cases (23%), among which 9 also carried <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic> mutations. High-resolution, genome-wide SNP array analysis was performed for 15 of the 16 uRCC cases carrying <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic> mutations and/or exhibiting 22q12 copy-number loss (referred to as the â€˜NF2 loss' subset from here onwards; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Thirteen cases were confirmed to exhibit hemizygous loss of 22q and the remaining two tumours (T22 and T64), known to carry <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic> somatic mutations, showed copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 22q (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Of note, frequent, concurrent <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic> somatic mutation and chromosome 22q loss has not been reported in RCC. Furthermore, a three-probe FISH assay was performed, which validated the 22q hemizygous loss cases (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=14) within the NF2 loss subset of uRCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Consistent with genomic analyses, the NF2 protein level assessed by immunohistochemistry was significantly lower in the NF2 loss subset than in the remaining uRCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>
          <p>Germline mutation of <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic> is the principal genetic event underlying the human neurofibromatosis type 2 cancer predisposition syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The role of <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic> as a tumour suppressor gene is further demonstrated by mouse models in which genetic loss of <italic toggle="yes">Nf2</italic> results in various cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. NF2, a pleotropic factor, plays key roles in cellâ€“cell contact inhibition, growth factor signalling, stem cell and Hippo developmental pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. We first focused on the NF2â€“Hippo tumour suppressor network, which was highlighted by a series of reports showing that NF2 enforces the Hippo tumour suppression signalling pathway by phosphorylating, sequestering, degrading and suppressing YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation, thereby disrupting oncogenic transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. To evaluate whether YAP/TAZ is active in subsets of our uRCC cohort, we determined YAP/TAZ protein expression, phosphorylation and intracellular localization by immunohistochemistry. When comparing uRCC with NF2 loss (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=16) to those without (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=43), there was a statistically significant stronger nuclear YAP/TAZ signal, correlating with negative to very low phospho-YAP signal, in NF2 loss tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). To confirm that nucleus-accumulated YAP/TAZ denotes an aberrant YAP/TAZ transcription program, we performed RNA-seq on seven uRCC (four with NF2 loss and three without). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) demonstrated a significant enrichment of an established YAP/TAZ transcription signature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> in the NF2 loss uRCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest a novel subset of 16 (26%) uRCC cases with NF2 loss that demonstrates dysregulated Hippo signalling and YAP activation. The importance of YAP/TAZ signalling in NF2 loss kidney cancer was further assessed using ACHN and LB996-RCC cells, two NF2 loss, nccRCC cell lines. Knockdown of YAP in ACHN or LB996-RCC cells resulted in a decrease of proliferating cells (S and G2/M phases; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), as well as a reduced colony formation in soft agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2h</xref>).</p>
          <p>Among this NF2 loss subset of uRCC, chromosome 1p and/or 3p losses were also detected in &gt;50% of cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Interestingly, while concurrent 3p loss and <italic toggle="yes">VHL</italic> inactivation were reported in âˆ¼90% ccRCC, our uRCC with 3p loss did not carry <italic toggle="yes">VHL</italic> mutation or display histologic features of ccRCC. Furthermore, the occurrence of <italic toggle="yes">SETD2</italic> (3p21) mutation was significantly higher in the NF2 loss than in the remaining uRCC tumours (44% versus 9%, Fisher's exact test, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.004). <italic toggle="yes">SETD2</italic> encodes a histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) methyl transferase. A complete functional loss of SETD2 determined by the respective loss of histone H3K36me3 mark was detected in all seven NF2 loss, <italic toggle="yes">SETD2</italic>-mutated cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). In contrast, 54 of the remaining 55 uRCC tumours retained the H3K36me3 mark. Recurrent mutations of the other chromatin modulating genes including <italic toggle="yes">BAP1</italic> did not show significant enrichment in the NF2 loss subset.</p>
          <p>The NF2 loss uRCC exhibited a range of architectural patterns with multinodular or infiltrative growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). The morphologic spectrum of our NF2 loss uRCC did not fulfill diagnostic criteria of type 2 pRCC or collecting duct RCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Nevertheless, as small number of RCC with <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic> mutations have been recently reported in pRCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and collecting duct RCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, it remains to be determined whether these tumours were distinct from or overlapped with our NF2 loss uRCC.</p>

          <title>uRCC with hyperactive mTORC1 signalling</title>
          <p>Somatic mutation analysis of our uRCC cohort demonstrated that potentially mTORC1 pathway activating mutations comprising <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> (5), <italic toggle="yes">TSC1</italic> (4), <italic toggle="yes">TSC2</italic> (3) and <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> (4) occurred mutually exclusively in 16 (26%) cases, which might indicate another distinct subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Mutations of these genes have been described in ccRCC (12%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, pRCC (8%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and chRCC (9%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Of the <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> mutations seen in this cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), I1973F has been described and shown to be hyperactive in cell-based assays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, whereas L2427R (recurred three times in our uRCC cohort) and V2475M mutations have not yet been reported. To interrogate the functional impact of individual <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> mutations, we generated MTOR L2427R and V2475M mutants, and assessed the mTORC1 activity by phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP1, two key mTORC1 downstream substrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. When the MTOR mutant was co-expressed with HA-S6K in 293T human embryonic kidney cells, L2427R exhibited higher activity, whereas V2475M showed baseline mTORC1 kinase activity comparable to the wild-type MTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Consistent with cell-based assays, immunohistochemistry of the uRCC with L2427R mutation displayed strong p-4EBP1 and p-S6 staining, whereas that of V2475M did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,d</xref>). These findings suggest that the recurrent I1973F and L2427R MTOR mutations are likely pathogenic, whereas V2475M could be a passenger mutation. Notably, all seven tumours with <italic toggle="yes">TSC1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">TSC2</italic> mutations had high level of p-4EBP1 (H score=300), whereas only two of four tumours with <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> mutations exhibited such staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Altogether, our integrated analysis demonstrated that 13 of the 16 uRCC tumours with <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TSC1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TSC2</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> mutations exhibited hyperactive mTORC1 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,e</xref>).</p>
          <p>While mTORC1 has been shown to be hyperactive in <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-deficient mesothelioma and meningioma cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, we did not observe hyperactive mTORC1 signalling in NF2 loss uRCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Within our uRCC cohort, the identified NF2 loss (26%) and mTORC1 hyperactive (21%) subsets were mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>).</p>

          <title>Additional molecular subsets detected in uRCC</title>
          <p>As germline and somatic mutations of <italic toggle="yes">FH</italic> have been described in hereditary leiomyomatosis RCC (HLRCC) and a small number of sporadic type II pRCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, we performed 2SC (2-succino-cystein) and FH immunohistochemistry to investigate the recurrent <italic toggle="yes">FH</italic> somatic mutations observed in three of our uRCC cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). FH protein loss and 2SC (detects aberrant protein succination) are highly specific markers for FH-deficient RCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. FH and 2SC assays were inversely correlated in our uRCC cohort, and they identified four tumours that were positive for 2SC and negative for FH staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Genetic testing revealed <italic toggle="yes">FH</italic> germline mutations in three of these four patients, confirming that they indeed represent HLRCC cases. The remaining FH-negative/2SC-positive tumour (T41) harboured somatic homozygous deletion of the <italic toggle="yes">FH</italic> gene, revealing a somatic mechanism that can lead to <italic toggle="yes">FH</italic> functional loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). On the other hand, one tumour (T71) with <italic toggle="yes">FH</italic> G401V somatic mutation was found to be FH positive/2SC negative, and lacked histologic features of HLRCC or FH-deficient RCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, suggesting that <italic toggle="yes">FH</italic> G401V might be better categorized as a passenger mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
          <p>We also discovered by IMPACT that one uRCC (T12) carried a <italic toggle="yes">TPM3â€“ALK</italic> fusion, which was further confirmed by FISH analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). The <italic toggle="yes">TPM3â€“ALK</italic> fusion has been reported in human cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, including in one uRCC case<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Reported rarely in children and adults, ALK translocation-associated RCC is currently considered as an emerging entity, awaiting further characterization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p>
          <p>Collectively, these four distinct molecular subsets (NF2 loss, mTORC1 hyperactive, FH-deficient and ALK translocation) accounted for 55% of our uRCC cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Of the remaining 28 (45%) uRCC, 8 cases carried mutations of genes involved in chromatin modulation (<italic toggle="yes">SETD2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">BAP1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A/C/D</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PBRM1</italic>); 5 in DNA damage response (<italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CHEK2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic>); and 15 without recurrent molecular features based on our analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The possibility of these tumours representing other RCC subtypes (for example, TFE3/TFEB translocation or SDHB deficiency) was also excluded by established diagnostic assays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>.</p>
          <p>Commonly mutated in VHL-deficient ccRCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, chromatin modulators <italic toggle="yes">PBRM1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SETD2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BAP1</italic> were recurrently mutated in uRCC that lacked <italic toggle="yes">VHL</italic> mutations. Our finding that these mutations also recur in nccRCC is in line with the recently reported mutations of SWI/SNF and chromatin modifier pathways in type 1 and type 2 pRCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Given the presence of mutations of chromatin modulation or DNA damage response genes in a wide variety of cancers and their known implications in tumorigenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, we tentatively grouped together the uRCC cases with mutations in these pathways and lacking other apparent driver alterations.</p>
          <p>Among the 15 cases lacking recurrent features (â€˜other' group), T62 and T69 had non-recurrent <italic toggle="yes">MET</italic> (H1094Y) or <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> (Y472C) pathogenic mutations, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Together, there were seven cases in which no mutation or other significant molecular alteration was detected by our panel of analyses, but the clinicopathologic features of these cases (for example, high-grade nuclear features, necrosis and so on) excluded the possibility of them being reclassified as renal oncocytomas. In addition, three uRCC tumours with somatic <italic toggle="yes">SMARCB1</italic> mutations (T23, T38 and T41) retained the INI1 protein expression (encoded by <italic toggle="yes">SMARCB1</italic>), and were histologically distinct from renal medullary carcinoma that exhibits characteristic INI1 loss and occurs in individuals with sickle cell trait or other hemoglobinopathies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).

          <p>Despite the relatively small patient sample size of our high-grade uRCC cohort, differential cancer-specific outcomes were observed among the above-defined molecular subgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). NF2 loss and FH-deficient uRCC appeared to have worse clinical outcome than mTORC1 hyperactive and thus far unspecified uRCC, whereas uRCC with mutations mainly in chromatin modulation or DNA damage response genes fared intermediately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>This study presents the first in-depth molecular characterization of high-grade uRCC, a rare and heterogenous group of aggressive tumours that poses one of the most important diagnostic and therapeutic challenges among rare kidney cancers. Our integrated, step-wise, molecular approach yields molecularly distinct subsets accounting for âˆ¼76% of the uRCC cohort, and we are able to show differential clinical outcomes associated with these molecular subsets. We identified 29 recurrently mutated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) including <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic> (18%), <italic toggle="yes">SETD2</italic> (18%) and <italic toggle="yes">BAP1</italic> (13%) as the most frequently mutated genes. Although some of these mutations are present in certain established subtypes of RCC, the overall mutation profiles, the frequencies of mutations in specific genes and a lack of characteristic molecular features of established RCC subtypes support the notion that these uRCC tumours are largely distinct from the established RCC subtypes and harbour their unique oncogenic pathways.</p>
        <p>This study identifies a subset of uRCC that is characterized by NF2 loss, dysregulated Hippoâ€“YAP signalling and aggressive clinical behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>). The majority (69%) of this subset demonstrates biallelic inactivation of NF2 with concurrent <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic> mutation and LOH, a molecular feature that has not been reported in RCC. In the remaining cases with only LOH of <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>, low NF2 protein levels were observed. While NF2 has been shown to be a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, it is possible that other mechanisms further inactivate its function in these cases. As the regulation of Hippo signalling could differ based on organ or cellular contexts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, the YAP activation we observed predominantly in the NF2 loss subset of uRCC suggests that NF2 inactivation is an essential mechanism dysregulating Hippo signalling in RCC. The high prevalence of NF2 loss in a distinct subset of uRCC suggests it acting as an early driver event in the tumorigenesis, although this remains to be further investigated. Other molecular features found in this subset of tumours include the enrichment of <italic toggle="yes">SETD2</italic> mutations, frequent 1p and 3p losses and aberrant histone methylation (absence of H3K36me3) in cases with concurrent 3p loss and <italic toggle="yes">SETD2</italic> mutation. The identification of this NF2 loss subset of uRCC provides an opportunity to improve our diagnosis of this particularly aggressive subset of tumours, and test new therapeutic strategies such as those aimed at interfering with YAP activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>, or the synthetic lethal interaction of WEE1 inhibition in H3K36me3-deficient cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>.</p>
        <p>The mTORC1 hyperactive uRCC displayed much higher levels of mTORC1 signalling than the other uRCC, and was associated with a better clinical outcome. This subset harbours molecular alterations similar to those identified in a small cohort of ccRCC patients who benefit long term from mTOR inhibitor therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>, and suggests a readily available targeted therapy venue for patients with advanced uRCC that belong to this subset.</p>
        <p>We detected three HLRCC cases with proven germline <italic toggle="yes">FH</italic> mutations in our uRCC cohort, emphasizing the wide histological spectrum observed in HLRCC-associated renal tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. We also found one case harbouring somatic alterations (homozygous deletion) that fully inactivate FH function. Together, these four FH-deficient tumours showed the worst clinical outcome in this cohort. Nonetheless, given the rare incidence of <italic toggle="yes">FH</italic> somatic alterations reported to this date in RCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, it remains unclear whether the clinical behaviour of a FH-deficient RCC due to somatic alterations resembles that of HLRCC. The current histological criteria and immunohistochemical markers for FH deficiency (FH and 2SC) appear to be insufficient to reliably distinguish the latter tumour from true HLRCC cases, and it remains critical to recommend genetic counselling when pathologic assessment raises a suspicion of HLRCC.</p>
        <p>We also identified a tumour with <italic toggle="yes">TPM3â€“ALK</italic> fusion, a second RCC case with this specific fusion reported in adults. Identifying these specific driver events supports dissecting them out from the uRCC category to facilitate future characterization of these emerging RCC subtypes.</p>
        <p>Similar to what have been described in ccRCC and pRCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, mutations in chromatin modulation genes are relatively frequent in uRCC, although none of which (for example, <italic toggle="yes">SETD2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BAP1</italic>) was found to be significantly associated with clinical outcomes in this cohort. We did not observe specific patterns of distribution for these mutations, except for the enrichment of <italic toggle="yes">SETD2</italic> mutations in the NF2 loss subset. Further validation studies are needed to clarify the roles of these mutations in the oncogenesis of various types of RCC.</p>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">MET</italic> mutations have been predominantly, but not exclusively detected in pRCC based on the recent genomic studies of RCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. While the discovery of <italic toggle="yes">MET</italic> H1094Y mutation in one uRCC may suggest it represents a pRCC with atypical histologic features, more importantly it provides a potential therapeutic option for this patient.</p>
        <p>Based on this molecular study of uRCC, it is tempting to speculate that NF2 loss, mTORC1 hyperactivity, FH deficiency and chromatin modulation/DNA damage defects could play key roles in the tumorigenesis and help explain the highly heterogeneous nature of uRCC. In conclusion, this study not only demonstrates shared molecular features between uRCC and other RCC subtypes, but also uncovers unique oncogenic pathways to uRCC, which could have future diagnostic, pathogenic and therapeutic implications for rare kidney cancer patients.</p>

          <p>Frozen or FFPE tissue samples were collected from primary nephrectomy specimens performed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and processed according to MSKCC institutional review board approved tissue collection protocols with informed consent from all patients. The study was approved by our institutional review board. All cases have been reviewed and confirmed to fulfill the diagnostic criteria of renal cell carcinoma, unclassified (uRCC) by three genitourinary pathologists (Y.B.C., V.E.R. and S.K.T.) based on the current World Health Organization classification and concensus diagnostic criteria of International Society of Urological Pathology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Ancillary studies such as TFE3/TFEB immunohistochemistry and FISH were performed to exclude tumours harbouring MiTF family translocations. Tissues were macro-dissected to ensure &gt;70% tumour content. DNA was extracted from tumour or matched normal tissue using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit or QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit (Qiagen) for frozen or FFPE tissue, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was purified from tumour and normal tissues using mirVana miRNA Isolation kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instruction for total RNA isolation. DNA from each sample was quantified using Qubit fluorometer (ThermoFisher). RNA from each sample was analysed using Bioanalyzer assay (Agilent Technologies).</p>

It is suitable for DNA extracted from either fresh-frozen or FFPE samples. The assay used for this study included 230 key cancer-associated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). In brief, barcoded sequences were prepared and captured by hybridization with custom biotinylated DNA probes for all exons and selected introns of these 230 genes using 100â€“500â€‰ng of input DNA. Captured libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq (2 Ã— 100â€‰bp paired-end reads). The raw reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19) using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment Tool (BWA-MEM), followed by duplicate read removal, base recalibration and indel realignment using GATK (v 2.6â€“5)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>.

Copy number was computed using tumour:normal ratios of normalized coverage data to determine amplifications and deletions except for data on chromosome X<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. IMPACT was designed to focus on somatic mutation detection by filtering out alterations also present in matched normal samples. Matching normal was available for 61 out of 62 uRCC cases and the normal DNAs were sequenced in parallel with the corresponding tumour DNAs. For the remaining case (T02), a randomly selected normal DNA sample was used as unmatched normal control.</p>

Representative regions were imaged through the depth of the tissue (compressed/merged stack of 12 <italic toggle="yes">z</italic>-section images taken at 0.5â€‰Î¼m intervals under the red, green and orange filter, respectively). A minimum of two to three tumour image fields (&gt;100 cells) were selected and the total number of signals scored for each locus.
