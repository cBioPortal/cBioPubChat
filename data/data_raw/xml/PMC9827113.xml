          <p>Colorectal cancer patients receiving KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> and EGFR inhibitors develop resistance alterations that largely converge on ERK reactivation, with <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> amplification standing out as a dominant mechanism that leads to oncogene-induced senescence off drug.</p>

          <title>Abstract</title>
          <p>With the combination of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> and EGFR inhibitors, KRAS is becoming a druggable target in colorectal cancer. However, secondary resistance limits its efficacy. Using cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and patient samples, we detected a heterogeneous pattern of putative resistance alterations expected primarily to prevent inhibition of ERK signaling by drugs at progression. Serial analysis of patient blood samples on treatment demonstrates that most of these alterations are detected at a low frequency except for <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> amplification, a recurrent resistance mechanism that rises in step with clinical progression. Upon drug withdrawal, resistant cells with <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> amplification undergo oncogene-induced senescence, and progressing patients experience a rapid fall in levels of this alteration in circulating DNA. In this new state, drug resumption is ineffective as mTOR signaling is elevated. However, our work exposes a potential therapeutic vulnerability, whereby therapies that target the senescence response may overcome acquired resistance.</p>
          <sec>
            <title>Significance:</title>
            <p>Clinical resistance to KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>–EGFR inhibition primarily prevents suppression of ERK signaling. Most resistance mechanisms are subclonal, whereas <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> amplification rises over time to drive a higher portion of resistance. This recurrent resistance mechanism leads to oncogene-induced senescence upon drug withdrawal and creates a potential vulnerability to senolytic approaches.</p>

<italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> is the most mutated oncogene in human cancer (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). It acts as a signaling switch that, when bound to GTP, orchestrates a program of cell proliferation and survival. Until recently, efforts to target KRAS have been unsuccessful due to its small binding pocket, high affinity for GTP, and redundant mechanisms of posttranslational processing. The development of allele-specific KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitors that trap KRAS in the inactive, GDP-bound state (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2, 3</xref>) led to a paradigm change, with clinical responses in 30% to 50% of patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutations (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4, 5</xref>).</p>
        <p>These agents are not as effective in colorectal cancers with KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutation. We have previously shown that the activity of these drugs in KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> colorectal cancer is limited because activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) reactivates ERK signaling and consequently combinatorial KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> and EGFR inhibition more effectively targets KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> colorectal cancer (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Early trial data provide clinical support for this observation: The response rate for sotorasib was 7% to 10% in colorectal cancer (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and, in the first report of sotorasib plus the EGFR antibody panitumumab, the response rate was 27% (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). For adagrasib monotherapy, it was ∼20%, and, for adagrasib with the EGFR antibody cetuximab, it increased to ∼40% (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Based on these data, combination treatments based on KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitors and EGFR antibodies are being evaluated in registrational, phase III trials.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, patients treated with these agents eventually acquire resistance, and the response to single-agent or combination treatment is brief. Several studies have characterized resistance to KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> monotherapy (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref>). Remarkably, these alterations are highly heterogeneous, including KRAS, BRAF, or MEK mutations, as well as gene amplifications and fusions, and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis typically identifies multiple resistance alterations in the same patient. Here, we sought to determine the landscape of genetic mechanisms of resistance to EGFR–KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibition in gastrointestinal cancer and to identify novel approaches to potentially overcome resistance.</p>

          <title>Mechanisms of Resistance to Combined KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> and EGFR Inhibition</title>
          <p>To identify mechanisms of resistance to the combination of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> and EGFR inhibitors, we grew the colorectal cancer cell lines C106 and RW7213, both of which are sensitive to this treatment (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), in drugs until the emergence of secondary resistance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Treatment with 3 μmol/L sotorasib and 50 μg/mL cetuximab led to massive cell death of both cell lines with few viable cells. Cells were therefore subjected to increasing doses of sotorasib (from 0.1 to 3 μmol/L) with 50 μg/mL cetuximab to generate resistance (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Resistant sublines grew well in drugs after a period of 4 months for C106 cells and 2 months for RW7213 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1C).</p>

          <p>Both resistant sublines expressed higher RAS-GTP levels than parental cells, and drug treatment led to incomplete inhibition of RAS-GTP (Supplementary Fig. S1D and S1E). Drug treatment of C106-resistant cells failed to suppress activity of downstream effectors in the RAS/ERK pathway, whereas RW7213 resistant cells experienced a reduction in pathway activity but continued to have high levels of p-MEK and p-ERK due to elevated baseline pathway activation. Targeted sequencing of the resistant sublines using MSK-IMPACT (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) identified acquired clonal <italic toggle="yes">NRAS</italic><sup>G12D</sup> mutation and subclonal <italic toggle="yes">APC</italic><sup>Q879*</sup> nonsense mutation in C106-resistant cells and amplification of <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> in RW7213 resistant cells, which have a homozygous (through loss of heterozygosity) and clonal <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> mutation (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Figs. S2A–S2E and S3A and S3B). Single-cell sequencing of the C106-resistant subline indicated that the <italic toggle="yes">NRAS</italic><sup>G12D</sup> mutation occurred in the same cells bearing the <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> alteration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), with an acquired gain of the mutant <italic toggle="yes">NRAS</italic> allele occurring in all cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In addition, the subclonal <italic toggle="yes">APC</italic><sup>Q879*</sup> nonsense mutation was found to be a late event in tumor evolution (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Figs. S2A–S2E). Copy-number analysis of the resistant RW7213 cells revealed the presence of more than 20 copies of <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic>, further validated by fluorescence <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH; Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). In parallel, a KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutant colorectal cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model (CLR113) that was initially sensitive to sotorasib and cetuximab combination treatment (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) developed acquired resistance after about 10 months that was associated with amplification of <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> [variant allelic frequency (VAF) 1.00, cancer cell fraction (CCF) 100%], <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic><sup>K601E</sup> (VAF 0.03, CCF 13%), and <italic toggle="yes">RAF1</italic><sup>S259F</sup> (VAF 0.03, CCF 10%) acquired alterations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and 1E; Supplementary Fig. S4). These data indicate that multiple resistance mechanisms can contribute to the survival of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutant cells and that <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> amplification may be a recurrent alteration at resistance.</p>
          <p>To evaluate resistance mechanisms to KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor and anti-EGFR antibody in patients, we collected circulating free DNA (cfDNA) from 12 patients with colorectal cancer treated with combination treatment [adagrasib plus cetuximab (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 8) or sotorasib plus panitumumab (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4)], who initially experienced tumor regression and then developed either radiographic (RECIST) or clinical progression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Patient characteristics and response information are summarized in Supplementary Table S1, and baseline tumor tissue sequencing results are shown in Supplementary Fig. S5. Emergent alterations identified at resistance (Fig. 1G; Supplementary Table S2) included <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> amplification, <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> mutations (G12A/D/F/LR/S/V, H95L/Q/R, and Y96D/H/N), <italic toggle="yes">NRAS</italic> mutations (Q61K/R), downstream ERK pathway alterations (<italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> mutations/fusions, <italic toggle="yes">MEK1</italic> mutations), receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation (<italic toggle="yes">MET</italic> amplification/fusion, <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion, <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> mutations), and <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> amplification. Similar to what was previously reported for resistance to KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor monotherapy and in accordance with our preclinical models treated with sotorasib–cetuximab combination, multiple resistance-associated alterations were identified in individual patients, with the majority predicted to prevent inhibition of ERK signaling by drug (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p>

          <title>Resistance Dynamics in ctDNA of Colorectal Cancer Patients on KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>–EGFR Inhibition</title>
          <p>Similar to resistance alterations to KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor monotherapy (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10, 11</xref>), all acquired alterations were identified at low VAF, at one tenth or one hundredth of the frequency of alterations identified at baseline. To better understand clonal dynamics of resistance to combination treatment in colorectal cancer, ctDNA was serially collected during treatment and sequenced about every 6 weeks in 4 patients (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>–<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>; Supplementary Table S3). Longitudinal analysis confirmed the emergence of multiple resistance alterations. Resistant alterations often emerged many weeks before the development of clinical resistance and remained at a low frequency, largely &lt;1% VAF, whereas the baseline alterations and tumor marker (CEA) rose higher during treatment. In multiple patients, once resistance alterations were first detected, each successive time point identified new resistance alterations with only modest changes in the VAF of the preexisting resistant alterations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>–<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>; Supplementary Table S3). We did not observe a clonal sweep with the emergence of a dominant resistance alteration in any patient. In several patients, the VAF of the putative resistance alterations actually decreased and became undetectable despite continued treatment. These included alterations expected to cause resistance to a KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor, such as the <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G13D</sup>, <italic toggle="yes">NRAS</italic><sup>Q61K</sup>, and <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic><sup>V600E</sup> mutations detected in patient 1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) and the <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic><sup>V600E</sup> mutation and <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> fusion in patient 3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). These data together suggest that resistant subclones do not grow effectively and are unable to grow out to dominate the population. Indeed, among the many low-frequency resistance alterations detected in patients, the only putative resistance genetic event that increased steadily in step with tumor marker response was amplification of the <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> variant. Clinical resistance to KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> and EGFR inhibition is thus characterized by the accumulation and loss of many low-frequency resistance alterations, whereas <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> amplification drives a higher portion of the resistance phenotype.</p>

          <p>Together with these effects on signaling, we also observed that 24 to 48 hours after drug withdrawal, RW7213 <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup>-amplified cells acquired a large and flat morphology, and this phenotype was maintained over time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). This feature is reminiscent of cellular senescence, a program that can be triggered by excessive oncogenic signaling (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). RW7213 resistant cells in which the drug was withdrawn showed an increase in β-galactosidase activity and decrease in cellular proliferation, as measured by Ki-67 staining, both consistent with a senescent phenotype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Senescent cells acquire a new metabolic state, are protected from apoptosis, and activate a secretory program known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP; refs. <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15–17</xref>). In line with a senescent phenotype, RW7213 resistant cells taken off the drug combination downregulated apoptosis markers; increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and uPAR, a marker of senescence (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>); and accumulated cytokines indicative of SASP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). By contrast, C106 resistant cells harboring <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> and <italic toggle="yes">NRAS</italic><sup>G12D</sup> mutations did not exhibit the senescence phenotype or markers (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B), suggesting that this effect is specific for <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> amplification. These data suggest that high levels of KRAS signaling, which are needed to drive resistance to the drugs, trigger oncogene-induced senescence upon drug withdrawal.</p>
          <p>To check for similar changes in the clinical setting, we evaluated activation of the MAPK and mTOR pathways in tissue samples from a patient who developed <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> amplification at resistance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Several patients with colorectal cancer had identifiable <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> amplification at resistance, and patient 12 underwent biopsy of a liver metastasis immediately before starting KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> and EGFR inhibitors (pretreatment 2021) and again at progression where tissue was collected 8 days after the stop of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> and EGFR inhibitor drug therapy and before the start of any new therapy (resistance 2022; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Sequencing and FISH showed acquired high-level <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> amplification at progression (Fig. 3F; Supplementary Fig. S6C). Phosphorylated ERK levels were high pretreatment (2+ staining involving &gt;90% of cells) and further increased at progression (3+ staining involving &gt;90% of cells). Phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (S235) levels were low prior to treatment (absent staining) and elevated (2+ staining involving 70% of cells) in the progression sample collected after 8 days of drug withdrawal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). These data demonstrate in a patient progressing with <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> amplification that, after drug stop, tumor tissue has elevated MAPK and mTOR pathway signaling. We further checked changes in p16 levels, which commonly associates with senescence (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), in these clinical samples as a marker for senescence and found rare staining pretreatment (2+ staining, involving 5% of cells) and increased p16 expression at progression (2+ staining, involving 65% of cells; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). These data provide the support that, in patients, tumors with acquired <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> amplification may also undergo senescence changes upon drug withdrawal.</p>

          <p>Hence, we used the RW7213 resistant cells to investigate the effects of MAPK signaling suppression after a period of drug removal. After stopping cetuximab–sotorasib combination treatments, we rechallenged the cells with either the same combination (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) or with the MEK inhibitor trametinib (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>) as a function of time. While drug treatment was able to significantly decrease MAPK signaling, the cells maintained higher levels of p-S6K and p-S6 that were not suppressed by drug treatment, suggesting a new steady state after drug withdrawal with higher mTOR pathway signaling. mTOR signaling activation has been associated with senescence, as it regulates several senescence-associated phenotypes (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). p-ERK was inhibited best after the shortest time off drug (2 days), and this time point was associated with a lower induction of p-S6 levels. However, rechallenge at longer time points could not suppress mTOR signaling or restore apoptotic potential (cleaved PARP).</p>
          <p>These data suggest that periods of drug withdrawal and retreatment will be unable to reestablish drug sensitivity and cell death. However, we hypothesized that the senescent state and associated activation of mTOR-dependent signaling in these cells may provide a therapeutic vulnerability. Indeed, the mTOR inhibitor AZD8055, which has been previously proposed as a senolytic agent (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), was able to inhibit S6K and S6 phosphorylation selectively in RW7213 resistant cells in which drug was removed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Proliferation assays show that RW7213 cells off drug are more sensitive to AZD8055 than cells maintained with continuous drug exposure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). To support the specificity of mTOR inhibition, we used another senolytic drug, the bCL2 inhibitor navitoclax (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and this compound failed to block cell proliferation in the RW7213 resistant cells after drug withdrawal or with continuous drug exposure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>).</p>
          <p>Altogether, these data suggest that there may be enhanced activity and selectivity of mTOR blockade in resistant KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> cancers with <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> amplification following drug withdrawal and nominates further exploration of a one–two punch approach of drug withdrawal and senolytic therapy as a potential strategy to overcome acquired resistance to EGFR–KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> combination in those tumors that acquired <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> amplification (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>).</p>

        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Here, we report the genetic mechanisms of secondary resistance to concomitant EGFR and KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> blockade in KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutant colorectal cancer. In agreement with previous studies, our patients show subclonal heterogeneity and acquired mutations at low variant allele frequencies. This may be due in part to the evaluation of ctDNA, as this method exposes tumor heterogeneity more than single biopsy specimens (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Sequencing data from our study and others (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref>) might suggest that a small fraction of cells may be sufficient to drive clinical resistance. This concept is in line with recent studies of metastatic behavior in which, for example, single-cell RNA sequencing of small-cell lung cancers identified a rare population of stem-like cells that appears to drive metastatic outcomes in this cancer (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, our study highlights that these low frequency alterations appear and disappear during treatment, and this may support an induction of mutagenesis due to drug (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and also that these lesions can be characterized by low fitness and may not effectively drive resistance.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the low frequency resistance mechanisms, we identify <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> amplification as a recurrent resistance mechanism that tracks with tumor markers and response and engages oncogene-induced senescence when the drug is removed. Previous reports showed that <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> amplification upon RAF inhibitor resistance can be modulated by intermittent treatment (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), and we show that amplified <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup> recedes in the absence of drug in patients’ plasma. Here, we describe the transition to a senescence state in a cell line and patient's tumor and hypothesize that the drop of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> in ctDNA is due to the protective effect of senescence from apoptosis and consequently the release of cell-free DNA. We also show in the cell line that the senescent phenotype that has high mTOR pathway activation prevents a strategy of intermittent therapy from overcoming resistance, and that in clinical samples from a patient with acquired <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> amplification, mTOR pathway signaling is induced after drug release and correlates with p16 induction as a marker of senescence. These results provide a possible mechanistic explanation for the worse outcomes seen with intermittent RAF inhibition for melanoma treatment in the clinic (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p>
        <p>Oncogene overexpression <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> is challenging, as cells select against this hyperactivation over time, and we were unable to generate KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-overexpressing cell lines. This suggests that <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup>-amplified cells need the adaptation underlying long-term drug exposure and acquired resistance to therapy and raises questions about what mechanisms regulate this adaptation and how can we target them.</p>
        <p>Our data, however, nominate a new potential approach to overcome acquired resistance by exploiting vulnerabilities due to the senescence program during periods of drug withdrawal to target resistant cells more broadly. In this work, we took advantage of the new dependency on mTOR signaling that develops when cells enter the senescent state because of excessive oncogenic RAS signaling. Activation of mTOR-dependent signaling is required for maintenance of cellular senescence (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15, 27</xref>), and drug withdrawal can be combined with senolytic approaches (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) to facilitate tumor clearance, as shown by us and others, by inhibition of mTOR signaling (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Additional mechanistic insights into mTOR activation and longer-term drug-off kinetics will be important to examine further in future studies. Other potential senolytic approaches can be based on exploiting SASP chemokines that can recruit immune cells, suggesting the potential to target resistant cancer cells with immune-checkpoint inhibitors (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29–32</xref>). Moreover, senescence-driven expression of uPAR could also become a target for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Further studies will provide important insights on how to effectively target KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutant cancers that developed secondary resistance to KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitors as single agents and in combination.</p>

After exposure to UV light, droplet PCR reactions were thermocycled with the following conditions: 6 minutes at 98°C, 10 cycles of 30 seconds at 95°C, 10 seconds at 72°C, 9 minutes at 61°C, and 20 seconds at 72°C; 10 cycles of 30 seconds at 95°C, 10 seconds at 72°C, 9 minutes at 48°C, and 20 seconds at 72°C; and a final step of 2 minutes at 72°C. PCR products were digested at 37°C for 60 minutes and posteriorly purified using 0.63× of SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter). Sample indices and Illumina adapter sequences were then added via a 9-cycle PCR reaction, and a second 0.63× SPRI purification was then performed on the completed PCR reactions. Libraries were analyzed on a DNA 1000 assay chip with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and sequenced on a NextSeq 550 instrument (Illumina, Inc.; 150-bp, paired-end reads). Sequence data were analyzed using the proprietary software provided by Mission Bio (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In brief, sequence reads were trimmed for adapter sequences using Cutadapt (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and mapped to the hg19 human genome using the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA; ref. <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) after extracting barcode information. Following mapping, on-target sequences were selected using the standard bioinformatics tool (SAMtools; ref. <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), and barcode sequences were error-corrected based on a white list of known sequences (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The number of cells was determined from barcodes based on the number of reads assigned to each barcode and amplicon read completeness. HaplotypeCaller (GATK v4.2.1.0; refs. <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44, 45</xref>) was used to genotype the mutations present in all single cells with a joint-calling approach. The mutations identified in each cell were further intersected with MuTect2 (GATK v4.2.1.0; refs. <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44, 46</xref>) to obtain high-confidence mutations. Genotyping calls were further examined and corrected according to variant allele frequency. Potential doublets or multiplets characterized by the existence of 2 or more cells that are captured within a droplet and linked to a single barcode were identified using DoubletD (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) and further excluded from the analysis. For genotype clustering analysis of the five known variants (<italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic><sup>G12C</sup>, <italic toggle="yes">NRAS</italic><sup>G12D</sup>, <italic toggle="yes">APC</italic><sup>H1490Lfs*17</sup>, <italic toggle="yes">ERBB3</italic><sup>V104M</sup>, and <italic toggle="yes">APC</italic><sup>Q879*</sup>), cells were included when these five variants met the criteria of read depth (≥10) and genotyping quality (≥60; ref. <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). In addition, subclones with a higher allele dropout (ADO) rate compared with the overall ADO rate of all cells were further excluded (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). For clonal architectures, fishplot was created using the fishplot package (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>).</p>
            <p>To estimate allele-specific CNAs, we used a pool of single, nonneoplastic, diploid cells identified in endometrioid endometrial tumors (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Read counts of amplicons for C106 resistant and nonneoplastic cells were obtained from MissionBio's pipeline and further used for allele-specific copy-number estimation. Amplicon read counts for cells with no coverage were imputed according to neighboring cells using MAGIC (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Imputed read counts were normalized to total library size for each cell. Amplicon copy-number ratio was calculated by dividing C106-R read counts with the median of nonneoplastic counts. Because C106-R cells were considered to be diploid in the matched bulk sequencing data, the amplicon copy-number ratio was further transformed into noninteger copy number by multiplying by 2. Finally, the gene integer copy number was obtained by taking the median value of the amplicon copy number for each gene and by taking the nearest integer value.</p>
