          <p id="P5">Every cell in the human body has a unique set of somatic mutations, yet it remains difficult to comprehensively genotype an individual cell<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Here, we developed solutions to overcome this obstacle in the context of normal human skin, thus offering the first glimpse into the genomic landscapes of individual melanocytes from human skin. As expected, sun-shielded melanocytes had fewer mutations than sun-exposed melanocytes. However, within sun-exposed sites, melanocytes on chronically sun-exposed skin (e.g. the face) displayed a lower mutation burden than melanocytes on intermittently sun-exposed skin (e.g. the back). Melanocytes located adjacent to a skin cancer had higher mutation burdens than melanocytes from donors without skin cancer, implying that the mutation burden of normal skin can be harnessed to measure cumulative sun damage and skin cancer risk. Moreover, melanocytes from healthy skin commonly harbor pathogenic mutations, though these mutations tended to be weakly oncogenic, likely explaining why they did not give rise to discernible lesions. Phylogenetic analyses identified groups of related melanocytes, suggesting that melanocytes spread throughout skin as fields of clonally related cells, invisible to the naked eye. Overall, our study offers an unprecedented view into the genomic landscapes of individual melanocytes, revealing key insights into the causes and origins of melanoma.</p>

    <body>
      <p id="P6">Cutaneous melanomas are skin cancers that arise from melanocytes, the pigment producing cells in the skin. Thousands of melanomas have been sequenced to date, revealing a high burden of somatic mutations with patterns implicating sunlight as the major mutagen responsible for their formation. It is currently unknown precisely when these mutations are acquired during the course of tumorigenesis and whether their rate of accumulation accelerates during neoplastic transformation.</p>
      <p id="P7">In normal skin, melanocytes reside within the penetrable range of UV-A and UV-B radiation in the basilar epidermis. They make up a minor fraction of the cells in the epidermis, which is mainly comprised of keratinocytes. Keratinocytes have a p53-dependent program that triggers apoptosis after exposure to high doses of UV radiation, resulting in the sloughing off of epidermal sheets after a sunburn<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. As a result, clonal patches of <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>-mutant keratinocytes are prevalent in sun-exposed skin<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, and these can eventually give rise to keratinocyte cancers.</p>
      <p id="P8">By contrast, the homeostatic mechanisms governing melanocytes and selective pressures operating on melanocytes during early phases of transformation are less well understood. While some melanomas arise from nevi (i.e. common moles), most arise in the absence of a precursor lesion. Understanding the mutational processes and kinetics of mutation acquisition in pre-malignant melanocytes of normal skin would provide important insights into the early phases of transformation, before clinically visible neoplastic proliferations have formed.</p>
      <p id="P9">Most DNA sequencing studies are performed on a bulk group of cells, yielding an average signal from the complex mixture of cells that are sampled. Bulk-cell sequencing of normal blood<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, skin<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, esophageal mucosa<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, and colonic crypts<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> has identified mutations in these tissues, including the presence of pathogenic mutations, offering valuable insights into the earliest phases of carcinogenesis in these tissue types. However, bulk-cell sequencing is not suited to detect mutations in melanocytes because melanocytes are sparsely distributed in the skin<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P10">Genotyping studies at the resolution of individual cells are rare and none have been performed on melanocytes. Genotyping an individual cell is difficult because there is only one molecule of dsDNA corresponding to each parental allele in a diploid cell. There are primarily two strategies to overcome this bottleneck. First, an individual cell can be sequenced after amplifying its genomic DNA <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic><sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> amplification regularly fails over large stretches of the genome, reducing the sensitivity of mutation detection, and errors are frequently incorporated during amplification, diminishing the specificity of subsequent mutation calls<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Alternatively, a cell can be clonally expanded in tissue culture, prior to sequencing, to increase genomic starting material<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, but only limited types of primary human cells can sufficiently expand in tissue culture, reducing the scope of this strategy. Here, we combine elements of each strategy, allowing us to genotype melanocytes from normal skin at single-cell resolution.</p>

          <title>A workflow to genotype individual skin cells</title>
          <p id="P11">We collected clinically normal skin from 19 sites across 6 donors. Skin biopsies were obtained from cadavers with no history of skin cancer or from peritumoral tissue of donors with skin cancer (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). All donors were of light skin tone, European ancestry (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>), and ranged from 63 to 85 years in age.</p>
          <p id="P12">From each skin biopsy, epidermal cells were established in tissue culture for approximately two weeks and subsequently single-cell sorted and clonally expanded. On average, 38% of flow-sorted melanocytes produced colonies, ranging from 2-3000 cells (median 184 cells, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), indicating that we are studying a prevalent and representative population. Despite the small size of these colonies, there was sufficient starting material to achieve an allelic dropout rate of only 0.14% (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P13">Next, we extracted, amplified, and sequenced both DNA and RNA from each clonal expansion, as described<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Our tissue culture conditions were tailored for melanocyte growth, but some keratinocytes and fibroblasts also grew out. The RNA sequencing data confirmed the identity of each cell (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>–<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). The matched DNA/RNA sequencing data also permitted genotype/phenotype inquiries, as described in subsequent sections.</p>
          <p id="P14">Polymerases often introduce errors during amplification, and these artifacts can be difficult to distinguish from somatic mutations. The matched DNA/RNA sequencing data improved the specificity of mutation calls because mutations in expressed genes could be cross-validated, whereas amplification artifacts arise independently during DNA and RNA amplifications and thus do not overlap (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). To further improve the specificity of mutation calls, we leveraged haplotype information to root out amplification artifacts. When reads are phased into their maternal and paternal haplotypes using heterozygous germline variants, neighboring somatic mutations occur within all amplified copies of that haplotype, whereas amplification artifacts rarely display this pattern (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p id="P15">Altogether, we were able to confidently distinguish true somatic mutations from amplification artifacts in portions of the genome that were expressed and/or could be phased. Variants that fell outside of these regions were classified as somatic mutations or artifacts based on their variant allele frequencies. Heterozygous mutations should have allele frequencies of 50%, whereas, amplification artifacts tend to have much lower allele frequencies. For each cell, we identified the variant-allele-frequency cutoff that would maximize the specificity and sensitivity of somatic mutation calls by comparing the variant allele frequencies of the known somatic mutations and the known amplification artifacts in the expressed and phase-able portions of the genome (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>–<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">d</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P16">To assess the quality of mutation calls, we explored the genomic contexts of somatic mutations and amplification artifacts classified by each of the methods described above (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). Somatic mutations – whether ascertained by cross-referencing RNA-sequencing data, or from their haplotype distribution, or inferred by their allele frequency – displayed a pattern similar to signature 7, known to be associated with exposure to UV radiation. By contrast, amplification artifacts were more similar to signatures scE and scF, recently defined as likely artifacts resulting from multiple displacement amplification<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p id="P17">Finally, we deduced copy number alterations from both the DNA-seq data and the RNA-seq data using the CNVkit software suite<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. As an additional filter, we required that copy number alterations coincide with a concordant degree of allelic imbalance over the region affected (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P18">In summary, we implemented a series of experimental and bioinformatic solutions to overcome the major obstacles associated with genotyping individual melanocytes. 133 melanocytes passed our quality control metrics and were included in all subsequent analyses. Tissue pictures, cellular morphologies, and genomic features are shown for each melanocyte in an extended dataset hosted by figshare (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/s/bb5614d5ab4554516278">https://figshare.com/s/bb5614d5ab4554516278</ext-link>)<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p>

          <title>Mutational landscape of melanocytes from normal skin</title>
          <p id="P19">For each clone, we performed RNA-sequencing of the entire transcriptome and DNA-sequencing on a panel of 509 cancer-relevant genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). For a subset of 48 cells we performed an additional round of DNA-sequencing over the entire exome, providing more power to measure the mutational signatures operating in those cells. The mean number of mutations per cell from targeted and whole exome sequencing were respectively 37 and 790 mutations.</p>
          <p id="P20">We observed an average mutation burden of 7.9mut/Mb (mutations per megabase); however, this ranged from less than 0.82mut/Mb to 32.3mut/Mb, depending upon several factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The mutation burdens of melanocytes first varied within people by anatomic site. As expected, melanocytes from sun-shielded sites had fewer mutations than those on sun-exposed sites (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">b</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Consistently, sun-shielded melanocytes had little evidence of UV-radiation-induced mutations, whereas, this was the dominant mutational signature in melanocytes from sun-exposed skin (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P21">Surprisingly, among sun-exposed melanocytes in this dataset, cells from the back and limbs had more mutations than cells from the face (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">b</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Typically, skin from the back and limbs is only exposed intermittently to sunlight and expected to accumulate lower levels of cumulative sun exposure than skin from the face, neck, and bald scalp. The finding of lower mutation burdens in chronically sun-exposed sites deserves further study as it indicates possible differences in mutation rate, DNA repair or turnover among melanocytes from these anatomic sites. However, our observations are consistent with the fact that melanomas are disproportionately common on intermittently sun-exposed skin as compared to other forms of skin cancer<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p id="P22">The mutation burdens of melanocytes also varied between donors. For example, we sequenced melanocytes from a common site, the back, of five donors. Among these, the melanocytes from donors 6 and 13 harbored the highest mutation burdens (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) with more than half of melanocytes exceeding the median mutation burden of melanoma – this was notable because these donors had skin cancer adjacent to the skin that we sequenced.</p>
          <p id="P23">For several donors, we observed a wide range of mutation burdens among the melanocytes harvested from the same anatomic site. This is surprising as cells originating from the same area of skin (~3cm<sup>2</sup>) would be expected to have similar levels of exposure to UV radiation and therefore comparable mutagenic profiles. To further understand the broad range of mutation burdens, we sought to identify genes whose expression correlates with mutation burden using differential expression analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). Among the significant genes, <italic toggle="yes">MDM2</italic> was more highly expressed in melanocytes with elevated mutation burdens. MDM2 promotes the rapid degradation of p53, raising the possibility that there is heterogeneity among melanocytes with respect to p53 activity, which could affect the ability of a cell to repair mutations or undergo DNA damage-induced cell death. Although MDM2 provides a convincing narrative to explain the mutation burden heterogeneity, it is just one out of a number of significantly correlated genes that may be contributing to the phenotype. Another possibility is that the melanocytes may have different residence times in the epidermis. For instance, the low mutation burden melanocytes may reside, or have resided for some portion of their life, in a privileged niche, such as the hair follicle, thereby protecting them from UV-radiation. Future studies will be needed to better resolve why melanocytes from a single site can exhibit such a broad range of mutation burdens.</p>
          <p id="P24">Melanocytes were harvested near a site with melanoma in two patients, and tumor tissue was available from one of these donors. The mutation burden of the melanoma, determined by bulk sequencing, was comparable to that of the individual melanocytes from its surrounding skin (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). There was no overlap between mutations in the melanoma and surrounding melanocytes, suggesting that few, if any, melanoma cells strayed beyond the excision margins into the normal skin. While more cases need to be studied, our findings suggest that melanomas have mutation burdens similar to their neighboring normal cells. This would contrast with colorectal cancers, which have higher mutation burdens than surrounding normal colorectal cells<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p id="P25">Copy number alterations were relatively uncommon in melanocytes (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> middle panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>), with the exception of recurrent losses of the Y-chromosome and the inactive X-chromosome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Mosaic loss of the Y-chromosome and the inactive X-chromosome has been reported in normal blood<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, suggesting that this is a generalized feature of aging. The rarity of autosomal copy number alterations in melanocytes from normal skin is consistent with previous reports that copy number instability is acquired during the later stages of melanoma evolution, and thus unlikely to be operative in pre-neoplastic melanocytes<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.</p>

          <title>Pathogenic mutations in melanocytes from normal skin</title>
          <p id="P26">We next explored the mutations to identify those that have been previously attributed as drivers of neoplasia. A set of 29 pathogenic mutations were identified in 24 different cells (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In particular, there were numerous mutations predicted to activate the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway. These include loss-of-function mutations in negative regulators of the MAPK pathway, affecting <italic toggle="yes">NF1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CBL</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">RASA2</italic>. There were also gain- or change- of-function mutations in <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">NRAS</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">MAP2K1</italic>, however, <italic toggle="yes">BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic> mutations – the most common mutation in the MAPK pathway occurring in melanocytic neoplasms<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> – were not detected.</p>
          <p id="P27">The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of melanoma distinguishes two major subtypes of cutaneous melanoma – the low cumulative sun damage (low CSD) subtype and the high cumulative sun damage (high CSD) subtype. Low CSD melanomas are driven by <italic toggle="yes">BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic> mutations and often originate from nevi<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. By contrast, high CSD melanomas are driven by a more diverse set of MAPK-pathway mutations, similar to the ones seen in our study, and they arise <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> rather than from nevi<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Previous functional studies suggest that the MAPK-pathway mutations in our study are weak activators of the MAPK signaling pathway<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>, possibly explaining why they do not give rise to discernible neoplasms by themselves, but they could eventually progress to high CSD melanomas should additional driver mutations arise (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P28">We also observed driver mutations in other signaling pathways, including mutations that disrupt chromatin remodeling factors and cell-cycle regulators (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These mutations are presumably not sufficient to induce a neoplasm but likely accelerate progression in the event that the harboring cell acquires a MAPK pathway mutation<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This evolutionary trajectory may explain the evolution of nodular melanoma, a type of melanoma that occurs in the absence of a nevus and grows rapidly<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p id="P29">Interestingly, no <italic toggle="yes">TERT</italic> promoter mutations were found in our study despite their prominence in melanoma<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>, suggesting that <italic toggle="yes">TERT</italic> promoter mutations confer little, if any, selective advantage to melanocytes outside of the neoplastic context.</p>

        <sec id="S5">
          <title>Melanocytes can persist as fields of related cells within the skin</title>
          <p id="P30">We found shared mutations between nine separate pairs or trios of melanocytes, suggesting that these cells stem from clonal fields of melanocytes in the skin (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). We ruled out the possibility that these melanocytes emerged during our brief period of tissue culture by growing neonatal melanocytes for several months and measuring their mutation burdens over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). The number of private mutations in the related sets of melanocytes, shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, was many orders of magnitude higher than would be expected from two weeks in tissue culture. Moreover, the private mutations from sun-exposed melanocytes showed evidence of UV-radiation-induced DNA damage (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>) – a mutational process that does not operate in tissue culture<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p id="P31">Four of the sets of related melanocytes harbored a pathogenic mutation in the trunk of their phylogenetic trees, implicating the mutation in the establishment of the field. It is possible that the remaining fields of melanocytes had a pathogenic mutation that we did not detect or appreciate, but we favor the explanation that fields of related melanocytes can also form naturally over time, for instance, as the body surface expands or as part of homeostasis.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p id="P32">There is a complex set of risk factors associated with melanoma, including cumulative levels of sun exposure, peak doses and timings of exposures throughout life, skin complexion, tanning ability, and DNA repair capacity<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. It is nearly impossible to quantify and integrate the effects of each one of these variables, but we demonstrate here that it is feasible to directly measure the mutational damage in individual melanocytes. Moving forward, the number and types of mutations in melanocytes warrant further exploration as biomarkers to measure cumulative sun damage and melanoma risk.</p>
        <p id="P33">Our study also offers important insights into the origins of melanoma. Idealized progression models typically depict melanomas as passing through a series of precursor stages, but in reality, most melanomas appear suddenly, without an association to a precursor lesion<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. We show that human skin is peppered with individual melanocytes or fields of related melanocytes harboring pathogenic mutations known to drive melanoma. These poised melanocytes likely give rise to melanomas that appear in the absence of a pre-existing nevus, once additional mutations are acquired.</p>
        <p id="P34">Finally, our genomic studies are an important resource to further understand basic melanocyte biology. For example, we found that melanocytes from sun-damaged skin vary in their mutation burdens by multiple orders of magnitude. Of note, a similar pattern of variable mutation burdens was recently reported in bronchial epithelial cells of former smokers<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Melanocytes with few mutations are likely to be more efficient at DNA repair and/or have occupied privileged niches, protected from the sun, such as in the hair follicle. Melanocyte stem cells in the hair follicle can contribute to the intraepidermal pool of melanocytes as is evident in vitiligo patients with repigmenting areas<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> – a similar process may be operative in the general population to replenish sun-damaged melanocytes.</p>
        <p id="P35">In summary, the genetic observations described here offer new insights into the early phases of melanocytic neoplasia, melanocyte homeostasis, and the consequences of UV radiation.</p>

          <title>Calling a preliminary set of variants</title>
          <p id="P54">Variant call format files for each clone were generated as described<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Briefly, Fastq files underwent quality checks using FastQC (v.2.4.1) and were subsequently aligned to the hg19 reference genome using the BWA-MEM algorithm (v0.7.13). BWA-aligned bam files were further groomed and deduplicated using Genome Analysis Toolkit (v2.8) and Picard (v.2.1.1). For each clone, variants were called using Mutect (v3.4.46) by comparing to bulk normal cells from a distant anatomic site. At this stage, the variants were composed primarily of amplification artifacts and somatic mutations. We leveraged the matched DNA/RNA sequencing data and haplotype information, detailed in the subsequent section, to distinguish between these entities.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="S15">
          <title>Harnessing the matched DNA/RNA sequencing data to remove amplification artifacts</title>
          <p id="P55">The DNA and RNA from each clone were separately amplified, and consequently, amplification artifacts were unlikely to affect the same genomic coordinates in both the DNA- and RNA- sequencing reads (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). In contrast, somatic mutations should always overlap, assuming there was coverage of the mutant allele in both the DNA- and the RNA- sequencing data. We applied the following criteria to determine whether this assumption could be met.</p>
          <p id="P56">To begin, we established rates of allelic dropout in our DNA- and RNA- sequencing data. From known heterozygous SNP sites, we empirically deduced that allelic dropout rates were less than 0.15% in our DNA-sequencing data. We achieved low levels of allelic dropout because of our high sequencing coverage, relatively uniform levels of coverage, and low levels of PCR-bias during amplification. Coverage in the RNA-sequencing data was more variable due to differences in gene expression, but from known heterozygous SNP sites, we empirically deduced that 15X coverage was sufficient to sample both alleles at nearly all variant sites. There were a small number of exceptions for which this did not hold true. Truncating mutations (nonsense, splice-site, and frameshift) are prone to nonsense-mediated decay and were commonly undersampled in our RNA-sequencing data relative to the wild-type allele. Also, mutations on the X-chromosome from female donors tended to be in 100% or 0% of RNA-sequencing reads, depending on whether they resided on the active or inactive X-chromosome. Aside from these examples, allelic variation in expression was minimal, particularly for highly expressed genes, as was previously reported<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p id="P57">Based on these observations, a variant was considered a somatic mutation if it was present in both the DNA- and the RNA- sequencing data from the same clone. Conversely, a variant was considered an amplification artifact if the following conditions were met: the variant was present in the DNA-sequencing data but not the RNA-sequencing data, and there was at least 15X coverage in the RNA-sequencing data, and the variant was not truncating or on the X-chromosome. We declined to make a call in either direction for any variant that did not fulfil these conditions.</p>
          <p id="P58">A limitation to this approach was that some variants did not reside in genes that were expressed. Nevertheless, 11.6% of variants could be classified as either a somatic mutation or amplification artifact by cross-validating the DNA/RNA sequencing data.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="S16">
          <title>Harnessing haplotype information to remove amplification artifacts</title>
          <p id="P59">We also used haplotype information to distinguish between somatic mutations and amplification artifacts. Somatic mutations occur in <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic> with nearby germline polymorphisms, and this pattern is preserved during amplification (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). By contrast, amplification artifacts do not occur in complete linkage with nearby germline polymorphisms for the reasons described below (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P60">The germline polymorphisms operate like unique molecular barcodes, designating which amplicons descended from each parental allele. The main reason why amplification artifacts are not in complete linkage with nearby polymorphisms is because there are multiple template molecules, associated with each parental allele, from which to amplify, and each template molecule can be amplified more than once – it is unlikely that the exact same mistakes are made during each independent amplification reaction over an error-free template. For example, we sequenced clonal expansions of cells, so each cell provided one molecule of double-stranded DNA from each allele. Furthermore, both strands of DNA are subject to amplification, thereby doubling the number of template molecules relative to the starting cell number. Finally, a single strand of DNA is repeatedly amplified during multiple displacement amplification, further enhancing the number of times an error-free template is utilized during amplification. Amplification artifacts therefore reveal themselves in the sequencing data by not occurring in complete linkage with nearby polymorphisms.</p>
          <p id="P61">There was an exception for which the pattern described above did not hold true. A copy number gain or copy-number-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) results in two or more copies of a single parental allele. If a somatic mutation occurs after the allelic duplication, then the somatic mutation would not be in complete linkage with nearby polymorphisms. Consequently, we did not apply this methodology to root out amplification artifacts over regions of the genome for which there was an allelic duplication.</p>
          <p id="P62">A limitation to this approach is that we used short-read sequencing technologies, so some variants were too far away from the nearest polymorphic sites to be phased. Nevertheless, 14.7% of variants could be classified as either a somatic mutation or amplification artifact, using the phasing approach.</p>

        <sec id="S17">
          <title>Inferring the mutational status of variants outside of the expressed or phase-able portions of the genome</title>
          <p id="P63">In total, 25.1% of variants could be classified as either a somatic mutation or amplification artifact, using either the expression or the phasing approaches, described above. The remaining variants did not reside in portions of the genome that were sufficiently expressed or close enough to germline polymorphisms to permit phasing. For these variants, we inferred their mutational status from their variant allele frequency.</p>
          <p id="P64">The majority of somatic mutations in our study were heterozygous, and these mutations, as expected, exhibited a normal distribution of mutant allele frequencies centered at 50% (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). The standard deviation of mutant allele frequencies in a given clone was dictated primarily by the number of starting cells, indicating that allelic biases, introduced during amplification, were the primary drivers of “noise” in our data.</p>
          <p id="P65">By contrast, amplification artifacts exhibited a much different distribution of allele frequencies. Most amplification artifacts occurred in later rounds of amplification, and therefore had extremely low variant allele frequencies. However, a small number of amplification artifacts occurred in relatively early rounds of amplification and were disproportionately amplified thereafter. As a result, amplification artifacts exhibited a distribution of allele frequencies with a low peak but a long tail, sometimes extending into the range of allele frequencies seen for somatic mutations (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). As expected, the tail of this distribution was more extreme in clones with fewer starting cells because amplification biases were more exacerbated in these clones.</p>
          <p id="P66">Due to the distinct distributions of variant allele frequencies for somatic mutations and amplification artifacts, a variant allele frequency cutoff could distinguish the vast majority of somatic mutations from amplification artifacts. However, the sensitivity and specificity of somatic mutation calls, using this approach, varied for each clone, primarily based on the clone size for the reasons described above. We were able to precisely define the sensitivity and specificity of mutation calls, and we could optimize the VAF cutoff for each clone by studying the overlap in variant allele frequencies from known somatic mutations and known amplification artifacts.</p>
          <p id="P67">For each clone, we had a set of known somatic mutations and known amplification artifacts, situated in the expressed and phase-able portions of the genome. We were therefore able to determine the proportion of false positives and false negatives under the assumption that all variants above a given variant allele frequency were somatic mutations. Here, a “false positive” is an amplification artifact that would have been called somatic mutations, and a “false negative” is a somatic mutation that would have been called an amplification artifact. We plotted the sensitivity and specificity of mutation calls at different variant allele frequency cutoffs for each clone, and we chose the variant allele frequency cutoff that maximized these values – this value was then applied to the variants whose mutational status was unknown – i.e. the variants outside of the expressed and phase-able portions of the genome. For clones greater than 5 cells, we could typically infer somatic mutations at greater than 98% specificity and 98% sensitivity (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>,<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">d</xref>).

We also integrated allelic frequencies from somatic mutations and germline heterozygous SNPs.</p>
          <p id="P69">First, we inferred copy number alterations from the DNA-sequencing data. CNVkit can be run in reference or reference-free mode. We elected to run CNVkit in reference mode, and in doing so, we created several references, encompassing panels of clones without copy number alterations that were amplified and prepared for sequencing in similar batches. This approach consistently produced the least noisy copy number profiles, as compared to reference-free mode or a universal reference. All other parameters were run on their default settings.</p>
          <p id="P70">Second, we inferred copy number alterations from the RNA-sequencing data. Briefly, CNVkit assumes the expression of a gene correlates with its copy number status. Of course, the expression of a gene is dictated by several factors, including, but not limited, to copy number. As an input, CNVkit accepts correlation values from an independent dataset between expression and copy number. Here, we included correlation values from the melanoma TCGA project. Given this input, CNVkit downweighs genes whose expression does not correlate well with copy number.</p>
          <p id="P71">Third, we calculated allelic imbalance over germline heterozygous germline SNPs. Copy number alterations are expected to induce imbalances over these sites. Additionally, we calculated the allelic frequencies of somatic mutations across the genome, as these, too, would be modulated by copy number alterations.</p>
          <p id="P72">Finally, we manually reviewed the copy number and variant allele information to call copy number alterations that were supported by each approach.</p>

Keratinocytes have a polygonal cell shape with more regular dimensions and grow in a very tight cluster due to the presence of desmosomes.

          <p id="P86">We established skin cells in tissue culture for 7-14 days prior to single-cell sorting and clonal expansion. Any mutation that arose after clonal expansion would be recognizable since it would only be present in a proportion of daughter cells, thus appearing subclonal. However, mutations that arose during the brief period of tissue culture preceding clonal expansion could be mistaken as a mutation that occurred while the cell was still situated in the skin. We therefore sought to establish the rate at which melanocytes accumulate <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> mutations in tissue culture to determine whether this was a meaningful contribution to the total mutation burden that we observed in our cells.</p>
          <p id="P87">Towards this goal, we followed the framework recently put forth by Petljak and colleagues<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> – in that study, the authors sequenced subclones of daughter cells from common cancer lines at different generational time points for up to 161 days, thereby revealing the mutational processes operating during their time in tissue culture. Here, we sequenced a bulk culture of normal human melanocytes derived from human foreskin to establish the germline variants and somatic mutations in the dominant clones. We continued to culture these cells, and at time points of 51, 63, 120, and 239 days, we single-cell sorted and clonally expanded individual cells. We genotyped each clonal expansion, following the same protocol that was applied to melanocytes in this study. From these analyses, we estimate that mutations occur at a rate of .045 mutations/Mb per 7 days in tissue culture. To put this in perspective, the mutation burden of melanocytes from the bottom of the foot was .25 mutations/Mb. Based on these findings, we conclude that the number of mutations accumulated in tissue culture was negligent as compared to the number of mutations that pre-existed in melanocytes that were profiled for this study.</p>

          <p id="P90">Pairwise comparisons of melanocyte mutation calls were performed to identify sets of melanocytes with shared mutations, and when this occurred, phylogenetic trees were constructed from the shared and unshared mutations. In <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, trunk lengths correspond to the number of shared mutations, and branch lengths correspond to the number of unshared mutations. If there was an allelic deletion in one clone, we did not assign mutations in the clone lacking the deletion over the deletion area to the branch. Shared mutations were discarded if there was insufficient coverage in the reference to rule out the possibility that the mutation was a germline SNP. Unshared mutations were discarded if sequencing coverage was insufficient in one clone to definitively make a call. In practice, few mutations needed to be discarded by these filtering criteria because we achieved high sequencing coverage in our clones.</p>

            <p id="P98"><bold>a,</bold> We sequenced a bulk culture of neonatal melanocytes to establish the germline SNPs and somatic mutations in the dominant clones. We continued to passage the cell line for 239 days, genotyping individual clones at the timepoints indicated to establish the rate at which mutations were acquired in culture. In parallel, Petljak et al<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> performed similar experiments on common cancer cell lines, and we analysed their data from a melanoma cell line (Mewo) included in their study. <bold>b,</bold> On average, the mutation burden of neonatal melanocytes and Mewo cells respectively increased by 0.090 and 0.086 mutations/Mb for every 2 weeks in tissue culture (we typically cultured melanocytes 2 weeks or less in this study). To put these mutation burdens in perspective, the average mutation burdens of sun-exposed and sun-shielded melanocytes from this study are shown in comparison. Based on these results, we conclude that the brief period of tissue culture contributed little towards the mutation burdens observed in our study.</p>

Variants that were validated as somatic mutations had variant allele fractions (VAFs) around 1 or 0.5, and variants that were invalidated had lower VAFs; however, PCR biases sometimes skewed these allele fractions. Variants that could not be directly validated or invalidated were inferred by their VAF (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">methods</xref> for details). The dotted line indicates the optimal VAF cut-off to distinguish somatic mutations from amplification artifacts for this particular cell’s variants (see <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref> for more details). <bold>f,</bold> Copy number was inferred from DNA- and RNA- sequencing depth as well as from allelic imbalance -- an example of a cell with a gain over chr. 5q, loss of chr. 9, and loss of chr. X is shown.</p>
