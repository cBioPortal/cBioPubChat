          <p id="P3">The implementation of targeted therapies for acute myeloid leukemia has been challenged by complex mutational patterns within and across patients as well as a dearth of pharmacologic agents for most mutational events. Here, we report initial findings from the Beat AML program on a cohort of 672 tumor specimens collected from 562 patients. We assessed these specimens using whole exome sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> drug sensitivity analyses. Our data reveal novel mutational events not previously detected in AML. We show association of drug response with mutational status, including instances of drug sensitivity that are specific to combinatorial mutational events. Integration with RNA-sequencing also revealed gene expression signatures, which predict a role of specific gene networks in drug response. Collectively, this report offers a dataset, accessible by the Beat AML data viewer (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vizome.org/">www.vizome.org</ext-link>), that can be leveraged to address clinical, genomic, transcriptomic, and functional inquiries into the biology of AML.</p>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
        <p id="P4">Approximately 21,000 people are diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with over 10,000 AML-related deaths annually in the United States<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Cytogenetic and sequencing analyses have revealed at least 11 genetic classes of AML<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and over 20 subsets can be assigned when also considering cell differentiation states of the leukemic blasts<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Deep sequencing of AML by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed a heterogeneous disease with nearly 2,000 somatically mutated genes observed across 200 patients <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Many of the recurrent cytogenetic events and somatic mutations have been shown to carry prognostic significance<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Some of the most frequent somatic variants can also be observed in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN)<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> that can transform into AML. These same mutations have also been observed in healthy individuals exhibiting age-related clonal hematopoiesis, which carries significant risk for the development of MDS, MPN, and AML<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P5">A small number of therapies targeted to mutational events have been developed for AML patients, with the current standard of care largely unchanged over the past 30–40 years. The first targeted therapy for AML involved use of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in combination with arsenic trioxide for patients with rearrangement of the retinoic acid receptor<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. More recently, fms related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitors have been developed for FLT3 mutational events that occur in ~20–30% of AML patients<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. FLT3 inhibitors deployed as single agents yielded responses of only 2–6 months<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Midostaurin, a broad-spectrum FLT3 inhibitor, was recently approved for use in newly diagnosed, FLT3-mutated AML patients in combination with standard of care chemotherapy <sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>; however, relapse was still prevalent in this setting. Targeting of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP(+)) 1, cytosolic 1/2 (IDH1/2)<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, has shown clinical benefit leading to approval of the IDH2 inhibitor, enasidenib, and the IDH1 inhibitor, ivosidenib<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Additional proposed strategies have included inhibition of epigenetic modifiers such as enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2)<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, LSD1 zinc finger family protein (LSD1)<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, and DOT1L like histone lysine methyltransferase (DOT1L)<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> based on direct mutation of these targets or synthetic lethality in the context of drug combinations (ATRA and LSD1 inhibitors) or specific genetic features (lysine methyltransferase 2A (<italic toggle="yes">KMT2A</italic>)-gene rearrangement for DOT1L inhibitors). Hypomethylating agents have been employed in AML patients with better responses reported for certain genetic subsets, such as those with mutation of TET2<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> or tumor protein 53 (TP53)<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Most recently, the BCL2 apoptosis regulator (BCL2) inhibitor, venetoclax, showed a ~20% response rate when used as a single agent in relapsed patients<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> with higher response rates (~60%) reported in combination with hypomethylating agents in newly diagnosed, elderly AML patients<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>.</p>

        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p id="P6">To better understand genetic or transcriptional markers and mechanisms of drug sensitivity and resistance in AML, we developed a cohort of 672 primary specimens from 562 unique AML patients on which extensive functional and genomic interrogations were undertaken. Detailed clinical annotations, including diagnostic information, clinical laboratory values, treatments, responses and outcomes were curated from electronic medical records and are reported in <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref> (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Tables S1</xref>–<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">5</xref>).</p>
        <sec id="S3">
          <title>Comparative Genomic Landscape of AML</title>
          <p id="P7">We performed exome sequencing on 622 of the specimens from the cohort representing 531 unique patients. The final, high-confidence variant list (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S7</xref>) revealed a range of 1–80 somatic variants per patient (cohort median of 13 somatic variants) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). Comparison of the top 33 most commonly mutated genes across Beat AML and TCGA<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> showed generally similar frequencies. Higher frequency of mutations in serine and arginine rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) were seen in Beat AML than in TCGA, and this difference was conserved comparing only the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> cases in Beat AML with TCGA (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In contrast, mutational events that were seen at less than 2% frequency across Beat AML and TCGA were much more divergent with variants in 221 mutant genes called in common, 939 mutant genes called only in TCGA, and ~1,500 mutant genes called only in Beat AML, irrespective of whether we compared only <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> or non-<italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> cases (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>,<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Most of these divergent mutational events were observed in only single patients, however, there were mutations in 11 genes that were called in 1% or more of patients in Beat AML, but were not observed in prior AML sequencing studies (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). Finally, co-occurrence and exclusivity of the most frequent variants were computed revealing significant patterns of mutational co-segregation suggesting biological cooperativity of certain mutational events (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>

          <p id="P8">RNA sequencing was performed on 451 specimens from 411 patients. Clustering of the 2,000 most variably expressed genes across the cohort revealed gene expression signatures that associated with many of the prominent genetic and cytogenetic disease groups (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). To understand the profile of sensitivity and resistance to a variety of small-molecule inhibitors, we profiled primary tumor cells from 409 specimens derived from 363 patients against a panel of 122 small-molecule inhibitors using an <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> drug sensitivity assay<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Drug sensitivity patterns were analyzed with respect to clinical and genetic features of tumors (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). We compared the average area-under-the curve (AUC) values for each drug between the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> and transformed samples via a series of single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. Generally, transformed cases showed less sensitivity to most drugs than <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> cases. Of the 122 drugs tested, 64 were significantly (false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; .1) more sensitive in the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> samples, while only 1 drug Panobinostat (HDAC inhibitor) was significantly more sensitive in the transformed cases (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). In addition, we analyzed the concordance of drug sensitivity patterns with respect to predicted target gene, gene family, or pathway for each drug (drug assignments to target families found in <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S11</xref>). This analysis revealed drug targets/families that were highly concordant amongst constituent members as well as drug families that were quite discordant (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). To create a global view of overall sensitivity or resistance of each case, we generated a heatmap of binary sensitive/resistant calls for each sample to each drug.

          <title>Gene Signatures of Drug Response</title>
          <p id="P9">We performed a cohort analysis to assess correlation between drug sensitivity patterns and mutational events or gene expression levels. Correlation of drug sensitivity with mutational events was performed by assessing the range of sensitivity of cases with mutation of an individual gene (as well as co-occurring mutational events) versus cases with wild type sequence for that same gene. Broad summaries of full cohort results are displayed in Circos and Manhattan plots (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7A</xref>, <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Individual drug/mutation associations are displayed on a Volcano plot with the horizontal axis showing difference in drug sensitivity between mutant versus wild type and FDR-corrected significance values<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> plotted on the vertical axis (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Some of the associations showing highest levels of statistical significance involved FLT3-ITD exhibiting sensitivity to FLT3 pathway inhibitors, which served as a proof-of-principle since FLT3 inhibitors are known to be more effective against FLT3-ITD AML. However, to reveal drug/mutation associations that were not biased by co-occurrence with FLT3-ITD, we also plotted the same analysis using only cases that were wild type for FLT3 (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7B</xref>). We also created Volcano plots that were specific to each individual drug (versus all mutational events) and for each individual gene (versus all drugs tested). All Volcano plots can be found with interactive features in our online data browser (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vizome.org/">www.vizome.org</ext-link>) and (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vizome.org/additional_figures_BeatAML.html">http://vizome.org/additional_figures_BeatAML.html</ext-link>).</p>
          <p id="P10">Mutation of several genes, most notably TP53 or ASXL1 transcriptional regulator 1 (ASXL1), were shown to cause a broad pattern of drug resistance. Interestingly, a few drugs trended more sensitive to TP53 mutant cases, such as elesclemol, or ASXL1, such as panobinostat, hinting at candidates to explore for AML cases with these poor prognostic features. Mutation of NRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (NRAS) or KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase) KRAS also correlated largely with resistance to most drugs, though did show the predicted sensitivity to MAPK inhibitors. It was interesting to note a stronger association of NRAS than KRAS mutation with MAPK sensitivity. IDH2 mutation conferred sensitivity to a broad spectrum of drugs, while mutation of IDH1 conferred resistance to most drugs. Mutation of RUNX1 correlated with sensitivity to PIK3C/MTOR inhibitors, such as BEZ235, and to the multi-kinase vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor, cediranib. Mutation of splicesome components U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1 (U2AF1) and zinc finger CCCH-type, RNA binding motif and serine/arginine rich 2 (ZRSR2) correlated with novel sensitivity to several drugs. The mechanisms underlying these latter sensitivity correlations (and many others in the dataset) merit further investigation. A significant association was seen between mutation of FLT3, NPM1, and DNMT3A with sensitivity to the FDA approved drug, ibrutinib. Since these mutations exhibit a significant pattern of co-occurrence, we next examined every combination of single, double, or triple mutation of these genes with respect to ibrutinib. We observed that DNMT3A alone or DNMT3A/FLT3 double mutant cases were not significantly different than wild type, while cases with FLT3-ITD alone or any variation of NPM1 mutation (including cases with all three genes mutated) were significantly more sensitive than wild type (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Ibrutinib is an inhibitor of BTK and TEC family kinases, although it can exhibit broad off-target effects when maintained in continuous culture with target cells. We noted that another kinase inhibitor with high specificity for spleen associated tyrosine kinase (SYK), entospletinib, showed a similarly significant pattern of sensitivity for cases with FLT3-ITD and NPM1 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), potentially pointing to an operationally important target for this disease subset. Indeed, prior work has suggested SYK as an interacting target of FLT3-ITD in AML<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Finally, we wanted to perform an additional analysis that leveraged multiple inhibitors with common targets to see whether this approach could identify additional associations. We focused on correlation of the four selective Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors on our drug panel (momelotinib, ruxolitinib, tofacitinib, and JAK Inhibitor I) with mutation of BCL6 corepressor (BCOR) alone or co-mutation of BCOR with DNMT3A, RUNX1, or SRSF2. By plotting the average difference of each JAK inhibitor between mutant and wild type groups of these four mutational categories and performing a one-way ANOVA analysis of the four groups, we found that co-mutation of BCOR with RUNX1 correlated with increased sensitivity to all four JAK kinase inhibitors, while BCOR mutation alone or co-mutation of BCOR with DNMT3A or SRSF2 showed no difference in sensitivity to the JAK kinase inhibitors, although BCOR mutation alone did show sensitivity to alternative drugs, such as the tankyrase/WNT inhibitor, XAV-939, and the multi-kinase inhibitor, crizotinib (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that JAK pathway dysregulation may represent a vulnerability within certain, specific combinatorial mutation settings and not in others.</p>
          <p id="P11">We also performed an integration of drug sensitivity data with respect to patterns of gene expression, comparing the 20% of samples with lowest AUC versus the 20% with highest AUC and assessing the most differentially expressed genes between those sample sets. This analysis revealed significant (FDR &lt; .05) expression signatures for 78 testable drugs on the panel (78/119 65.5%). As an example, the 20% most and least sensitive cases to ibrutinib could be clearly distinguished by an expression signature of 17 genes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>). Expression signature heatmaps for each drug can be found in our online data browser (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vizome.org/additional_figures_BeatAML.html">http://vizome.org/additional_figures_BeatAML.html</ext-link>).</p>
          <p id="P12">Finally, to assess the joint contributions of both mutation and system-level co-expression patterns (based on de-novo network inference) in predicting drug response, multivariate modeling was performed. This integrated analysis allows us to move beyond the significant associations of single mutations (such as FLT3-ITD and NPM1). We performed a weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) analysis of RNA-sequencing data that identified 14 sets of genes where gene expression patterns showed significant clustering across the cohort (clusters contained both elevated and decreased gene expression events). We performed iterative regression modeling (lasso) to understand how strongly any mutational event or any of these 14 gene expression clusters correlated with sensitivity or resistance to any of the drugs on the panel. We identified numerous, novel co-occurrences of mutations and expression clusters that were associated with drug sensitivity or resistance, with co-occurrences to ibrutinib shown as an example (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>). For ibrutinib, these co-occurrences included a co-expression cluster of 345 genes (using a color labeling scheme and indicated as “turquoise”) that correlated with drug sensitivity and frequently co-occurred with FLT3-ITD, which also correlated with drug sensitivity. There was significant overlap between this “turquoise” gene expression cluster and the 17-gene signature in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> (indicated by the ratio of observed overlap to expected or representation factor: 13.6; P&lt;1.734e-04). It is important to note that network analysis of this gene expression cluster highlighted enrichment for a number of immune-related pathways, which was not detected within the 17-gene signature (displayed at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vizome.org/additional_figures_BeatAML.html">http://vizome.org/additional_figures_BeatAML.html</ext-link>). We also identified a 110-gene subnetwork (labeled as “magenta” in Figure 6C), which was associated with resistance to ibrutinib and was significantly associated with adverse ELN 2017 risk. To look more broadly at associations between mutations or gene expression clusters, we summarized drugs at family level to assess the frequency by which mutations and gene expression clusters were selected in iterative regression modeling (displayed at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vizome.org/additional_figures_BeatAML.html">http://vizome.org/additional_figures_BeatAML.html</ext-link>)</p>

        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p id="P13">In sum, here we report the largest functional genomic dataset of primary tumor biopsies to date. We present a cohort of AML patient specimens for which we have performed detailed clinical annotations, genomic and transcriptomic analyses, and <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> drug sensitivity studies, and we provide analytical approaches for data integration. Each of these datasets alone has revealed new information about the biology and potential translational approaches in AML, and the integration of these datasets has been revealing of new markers and mechanisms of drug sensitivity and resistance that merit further study. These data have all been made publicly available through the NIH/NCI dbGaP and Genomic Data Commons (GDC) resources, and we have developed tools to facilitate user interface with the dataset (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vizome.org/">www.vizome.org</ext-link>).

          <p id="P14">All patients gave informed consent to participate in this study, which had the approval and guidance of the institutional review boards at Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU), University of Utah, University of Texas Medical Center (UT Southwestern), Stanford University, University of Miami, University of Colorado, University of Florida, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Fox Chase Cancer Center and University of Kansas (KUMC). Samples were sent to the coordinating center (OHSU; IRB#9570; #4422; <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT01728402">NCT01728402</ext-link>) where they were coded and processed. Specific names of centers associated with each specimen were coded and centers providing less than 5 samples were aggregated together and given one center identifier. Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation from freshly obtained bone marrow aspirates or peripheral blood draws. Cell pellets were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent DNA isolation (Qiagen, DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit), freshly pelleted cells were lysed immediately in guanidinium thiocyanate (GTC) lysate for subsequent RNA isolation (Qiagen, RNeasy Mini Kit), and freshly isolated mononuclear cells were plated into an <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> drug sensitivity assays within 24 hours (described in detail below). Skin punch biopsies were collected at the site of Jamshidi needle insertion for subsequent bone marrow biopsies and genomic DNA was isolated for use as matched normal controls for exome sequencing (Qiagen, DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit). Clinical, prognostic, genetic, cytogenetic, and pathologic lab values as well as treatment and outcome data were manually curated from patient electronic medical records. Patients were assigned a specific diagnosis based on the prioritization of genetic and clinical factors as determined by WHO guidelines. To prevent re-identification, any patient over the age of 90 was placed into a &gt;90 aggregated age bracket. Genetic characterization of the leukemia samples included results of a clinical deep-sequencing panel of genes commonly mutated in hematologic malignancies (Sequenome and GeneTrails (OHSU); Foundation Medicine (UTSW); Genoptix; and Illumina).</p>

          <title>Whole Exome and Custom Capture Validation Sequencing</title>
          <p id="P15">For exome sequencing, Illumina Nextera RapidCapture Exome capture probes and protocol were utilized, which provided coverage of 37 Mb of genomic DNA coding regions. Briefly, following initial QC on a TapeStation (Agilent), 50 ng of intact genomic DNA was fragmented and tagged (tagmentation) in a single step. Following clean-up, the tagmented DNA was amplified by 10 cycles of PCR, which added the indexed adaptors for clustering and sequencing. Libraries were hybridized to capture pools in 12 sample sets with two rounds of hybridization performed to increase specificity. Libraries recovered with streptavidin magnetic beads were amplified by 10 cycles of PCR, unincorporated reagents were removed with AMPure beads (Agencourt), and validated on the TapeStation. Quantification of capture pools was done using real time PCR (Kapa). Libraries were denatured, flow cells set up using the cBot (Illumina), and run on a HiSeq 2500 using paired end 100 cycle protocols. For the AML tumor samples, 5 or 6 lanes were run per capture group. For the matched skin biopsy samples, 3 lanes (or equivalent) were run per capture group. The instrument and chemistry for all capture groups are provided in the Supplementary dashboard tables (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S12</xref>,<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">13</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P16">For validation of sequencing results, an 11.9 megabase custom capture library was developed that provided coverage of all variants previously reported in AML as well as all new variants detected from exome sequencing in this study (Genes, Variants, and Capture Regions for this custom library are found in <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S14</xref>).

Initial data processing and alignments were performed with commonly used analytical tools. For each flowcell and each sample, the FASTQ files were aggregated into single files for read 1 and 2. During this process these reads were trimmed by 3 on the 5’ end and 5 on the 3’ end. BWA MEM version 0.7.10-r789<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> was used to align the read pairs for each sample-lane FASTQ file. As part of this process, the flowcell and lane information was kept as part of the read group of the resulting SAM file. The Genome Analysis Toolkit (v3.3) and the bundled Picard (v1.120.1579) were used<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> for alignment post-processing. The files contained within the Broad’s bundle 2.8 were used including their version of the build 37 human genome (These files were downloaded from: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ftp://ftp.broadinstitute.org/bundle/2.8/b37/">ftp://ftp.broadinstitute.org/bundle/2.8/b37/</ext-link>).

          <p id="P24">Mutect v1.1.7<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> was run using default parameters except that no limit was placed on the number or frequency of the alternative allele frequency in the normal to help address normal contamination.</p>

The MAF was converted to VCF files using the vcf2maf suite<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. The resulting VCF files were lifted over from NCBI36 to GRCh37 of the human genome using CrossMap<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>.

Variants from <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref> in Jaiswal et al 2014<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> were extracted and further processed removing variants that were ambiguous in terms of external sources and could not be found in their whole exome sequencing (WES) variants. The unique set of BeatAML variants was annotated relative to RefSeq transcripts using Ensembl VEP similar to above and all consequences were kept. This set of variants and consequences was searched against the set of processed Jaiswal variants.</p>
          <p id="P29">Using the runs from MuTect and VarScan, these data were next filtered to keep only the protein impacting SNVs and indels from Mutect and VarScan2 and filtered requiring that the variants had at least 5 reads and either not be seen in the exome aggregation consortium (ExAC)<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> or be seen at a frequency &lt; .01. These data present several additional challenges. First somatic calls cannot be obtained directly from the tumor-only samples, second there is always a possibility of tumor contamination of the skin samples for those samples that were paired. To address these issues and maximize comparability we used an iterative approach. The following was done separately for the two genotypers:

          <p id="P37">The data from the two genotypers were combined along with FLT3-ITD calls from Pindel<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>. Comparing our variant lists from whole exome sequencing versus our custom capture validation sequencing, we noticed, similar to others<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>, that low allele frequency C-&gt;A variants (&lt; 15%) tended to have poor concordance (7.7%; data not shown) between the initial run and the technical validation run.

Briefly, poly(A)+ RNA was chemically fragmented. Double stranded cDNAs were synthesized using random hexamer priming with 3’ ends of the cDNA adenylated then indexed adaptors were ligated. Library amplification was performed using three-primer PCR using a uracil DNA glycosylase addition for strandedness. Libraries were validated with the Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and combined to run 4 samples per lane, with a targeted yield of 200 million clusters. Combined libraries were denatured, clustered with the cBot (Illumina), and sequenced on the HiSeq 2500 using a 100-cycle paired end protocol. In addition to the AML samples, there was also a sample of purified CD34 molecule (CD34)+ cells from healthy control bone marrow, which was included in each sample group (for a total of 12 times sequencing this control RNA). This control served as both a healthy comparator and a quality check on inter-group batch effects. 21 additional, individual healthy bone marrow samples were also included, two of which were CD34-selected (17–00053 and 17–00056) with the other 19 being whole mononuclear bone marrow cells from healthy donors.</p>

Due to the heterogeneity of clinical expression data we generated ‘signed hybrid’ networks using ‘bicor’ correlation setting the max proportion of outliers to .1<sup><xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup>. We ran the procedure multiple times, varying several parameters to choose the most relevant set for further analysis. The WGCNA procedure was run on datasets formed from the top 2,000 and 5,000 most variable genes. For each dataset we set the ‘power’ variable to either 2 or 3. For each of these runs we varied the module detection parameters of dynamicTreeCut<sup><xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup>, namely the deepSplit parameter was set to 0 or 2 and the pamStage parameter was set to TRUE or FALSE.

Significance of modules was determined by computing a Zscore of each of these values relative to the mean and standard deviation of those from 100 random assignment of modules. We chose the set of modules to use in our analyses as those that were most correlated with the ‘specimentSpecificDx’ using the module quality as a tie-breaker. The analysis set of modules was chosen to be the version using the 5,000 most variable genes, power set to 2 and modules formed using deepSplit=2 and pamStage=F. Of this set of modules only the grey module didn’t have a summary Z statistic (median across the 4 density measures) of at least 2.

The overall similarity of the genotypes of each pair of samples were computed, termed identity by state (IBS) and a hierarchical clustering was performed using one minus this similarity. From this clustering and visualization we had devised hard cutoffs for further inspection based on the types of data being compared. For instance samples not meeting the specified IBS thresholds (DNA-DNA=.9; RNA-RNA=.83; DNA-RNA=.89) were subject to manual review. Based on the dendrogram structure as well as the clinical/lab information, samples were either excluded, assigned to a different patient ID or in rare cases assigned to a different sample. It was observed that bone marrow transplants between sample collections produced a noticeable but milder effect in these dendrograms and such samples were flagged for removal in RNA-sequencing analysis and for treatment as tumor-only samples in the WES analysis as is described in the ‘WES Variant Detection’ section.</p>

It was determined that the RNA-sequencing calls did not provide additional resolution in detecting these known fusions and was not performed on all the samples so the consensus was limited to the clinical karyotype calls as well as the specific diagnosis categorization (which was determined based on karyotype and other cytogenetic clinical tests). Overall the calls were based on the karyotype data except in 10 cases, 3 where the karyotype and diagnosis was sufficiently complex to warrant a separate ‘Complex’ categorization. The remaining 7 of these cases were set to the specific diagnosis classification. It should be noted there was additional support from the RNA-sequencing data for several of these cases.</p>

As we have observed previously that the clustering of ethnicities for RNA-sequencing samples are more diffuse than exome sequencing, we assigned the final inferred ethnicity to each patient based on the distinct WES calls if available, deferring to RNA-sequencing only if not available. If multiple exome sequencing samples were present with discrepant calls, the patient was subject to manual review. The only patient where this occurred was patient 4043, a self-identified Hispanic who had 2 RNA samples and an exome sequencing sample inferred as White and one exome sample inferred to be HispNative.

Drug plates were created using inhibitors purchased from LC Laboratories and Selleck Chemicals and master stocks were reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at −80 °C. Master plates were created by distributing a single agent per well in a seven-point concentration series, created from three-fold dilutions of the most concentrated stock resulting in a range pf 10 μM to 0.0137 μM for each drug (except dasatinib, ponatinib, sunitinib, and YM-155 which were plated at a concentration range of 1 μM to 0.00137 μM). DMSO control wells and positive control wells containing a drug combination of Flavopiridol, Staurosporine and Velcade were placed on each plate, with the final concentration of DMSO ≤0.1% in all wells.

Daughter and destination plates were sealed with pealable thermal seals using a PlateLoc thermal sealer. Destination plates were stored at −20 °C for no more than three months and thawed immediately before use. Primary mononuclear cells were plated across single-agent inhibitor panels within 24 h of collection.

          <p id="P165"><bold>(A)</bold> Frequency of the 33 mutational events that were cumulatively most frequent in Beat AML (n=531 patients) and TCGA (n=200 patients). Top row represents the full Beat AML cohort and the middle bar represents only the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> Beat AML cases. Mutations were summarized by gene as was done by TCGA whereas the FLT3-ITD mutations were kept separate in the rest of this manuscript.</p>
          <p id="P166"><bold>(B)</bold> Mutational events at 2% frequency or less in the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> cases of Beat AML and TCGA were compared for overlap. Venn diagram displays the overlap with the small circles within each compartment representing a size-scaled frequency of each mutational event.</p>
          <p id="P167"><bold>(C)</bold> Analysis as in panel B with only the non-<italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> Beat AML cases versus TCGA.</p>
          <p id="P168"><bold>(D)</bold> Co-occurrence or exclusivity of the most recurrent mutational events in the Beat AML cohort (n=531 patients) were assessed using the DISCOVER<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> method with a dot plot indicating the odds ratio of co-occurrence (blue) or exclusivity (red) using color-coding and circle size as well as asterisks that indicate FDR-corrected statistical significance.</p>

          <title>Integration of Genetic Events with Drug Sensitivity.</title>
          <p id="P169"><bold>(A)</bold> Average difference in AUC drug response between mutant and wild type cases was determined using a two-sided t-test from a linear model fit (plotted on the horizontal axis and FDR-corrected q-value is plotted on the vertical axis). FDR was computed using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) over all the drugs. The n used to correlate each mutational event with drug sensitivity is reported in the <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref> (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S17</xref>). Expanded and interactive plots are available in our online data browser (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vizome.org/">www.vizome.org</ext-link>) and (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vizome.org/additional_figures_BeatAML.html">http://vizome.org/additional_figures_BeatAML.html</ext-link>).</p>
          <p id="P170"><bold>(B)</bold>Area under the curve for ibrutinib or entospletinib (n=277 or 168 patient samples, respectively) was plotted for cases with single, double, or triple mutation of FLT3-ITD, NPM1, and DNMT3A with the mean and one s.d. indicated by center and outer gray bars, respectively. An ANOVA was conducted using the Bonferroni approach (statistical results and sample size for all groups reported in <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Tables S18</xref>,<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">19</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P171"><bold>(C)</bold> Inhibitors of JAK family kinases were assessed for activity against cases with BCOR mutation alone or BCOR in combination with SRSF2, RUNX1, or DNMT3A. The AUC values are plotted per case with the mean and one standard deviation indicated by center and outer gray bars, respectively. There was a significant difference in AUC by two-sided t-test (<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>(42)=−2.489, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>=0.0168, 95% CI [−73.018, −7.643]) between BCOR and RUNX1 (n=16) versus the average of BCOR alone (n=16), BCOR and SRSF2 (n=8), and BCOR and DNMT3A (n=4).</p>
