          <p id="Par1">Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is a form of skin cancer originating from keratinocytes in the skin. It is the second most common type of cancer and is responsible for an estimated 8000 deaths per year in the United States. Compared to other cancer subtypes with similar incidences and death tolls, our understanding of the somatic mutations driving cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is limited. The main challenge is that these tumors have high mutation burdens, primarily a consequence of UV-radiation-induced DNA damage from sunlight, making it difficult to distinguish driver mutations from passenger mutations. We overcame this challenge by performing a meta-analysis of publicly available sequencing data covering 105 tumors from 10 different studies. Moreover, we eliminated tumors with issues, such as low neoplastic cell content, and from the tumors that passed quality control, we utilized multiple strategies to reveal genes under selection. In total, we nominated 30 cancer genes. Among the more novel genes, mutations frequently affected <italic toggle="yes">EP300</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PBRM1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">USP28</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">CHUK</italic>. Collectively, mutations in the NOTCH and p53 pathways were ubiquitous, and to a lesser extent, mutations affected genes in the Hippo pathway, genes in the Ras/MAPK/PI3K pathway, genes critical for cell-cycle checkpoint control, and genes encoding chromatin remodeling factors. Taken together, our study provides a catalog of driver genes in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, offering points of therapeutic intervention and insights into the biology of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p id="Par2">Over the past decade, large-scale DNA-sequencing studies have profiled a wide range of different cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. These studies have revealed candidate genes for targeted therapy and genetically distinct subtypes of cancer—information that has changed the way in which many cancers are treated. Moreover, at a basic science level, these studies have revealed fundamental insights into the biology of these cancers, often forming the basis of downstream hypothesis-driven work.</p>
        <p id="Par3">Given these achievements, there has been momentum to genomically profile the rarest of cancer subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, yet cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the second most common form of cancer in the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, has largely been overlooked. Thirty-four cancer subtypes were included in The Cancer Genome Atlas program (TCGA)—a comprehensive effort to catalog the driver genes in cancer—but regrettably, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma was left out. Several individual laboratories have sequenced the exomes or genomes of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, examples of which are here<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, but the small size of each study and difficulties in interpreting the high mutational loads in cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas have precluded the research community from settling upon a consensus set of driver genes. Indeed, power calculations suggest that the largest exome study to date can only recognize genes under positive selection in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma that are mutated in ~50% or more of tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par4">One reason why large-scale sequencing consortiums have overlooked cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas is because cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas are thought of as non-life-threatening tumors; however, this reputation is misleading. Most cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas are caught at an early stage, reducing their mortality, but 8000 people per year still die from this disease in the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. To put this death toll in perspective, it is on par with that of melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, for which nearly 1000 tumors have been sequenced, to date, at exome or genome resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par5">A better understanding of the genetic drivers of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma promises to improve treatment strategies. The current standard of care is for patients to receive immune-checkpoint blockade therapies, but roughly half do not respond and the responses are not always durable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In addition, the risk of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is nearly 100-fold higher in immunosuppressed patients, such as organ transplant recipients, who are typically not eligible to receive immunotherapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Establishing the driver mutations in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma promises to reveal new points for therapeutic intervention in this deadly tumor subtype. Towards this goal, we performed a meta-analysis of publicly available exome-sequencing data from cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas.</p>

          <p id="Par7">The main issues affecting our ability to detect somatic mutations in each tumor were the neoplastic cell content, the mean sequencing coverage, and/or the variability in sequencing coverage. We bioinformatically quantified tumor cellularities, and they ranged from 12% to 99%. The mean sequencing coverages ranged from 12.4× to 498×. Finally, some tumors had high sequencing coverages, on average, but extreme variability in coverage, primarily linked to the GC content of their targets (see Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref> for an example). To account for each of these potential issues, we used the Footprints software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> to count the exact number of basepairs in each sample with sufficient sequencing coverage to make a mutation call. For the average sample, we could detect mutations at 91.2% of target bases, though this ranged from 52.3% to nearly 100% (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par8">Establishing the extent to which we could detect mutations in each tumor allowed us to accurately calculate mutation burdens, irrespective of technical variables that are known to distort these measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Moreover, the performance of cancer gene discovery tools deteriorates when there are large portions of the exome for which a mutation call cannot be made, and we were able to exclude problematic tumors from these analyses (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). Altogether, we improved the caliber of candidate cancer genes by aggregating a large cohort of tumors, reanalyzing the raw sequencing data, and applying rigorous quality control measures for sample inclusion.</p>

          <p id="Par10">First, two cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas came from patients with xeroderma pigmentosum—a rare hereditary disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to UV radiation and caused by germline mutations in genes involved in nucleotide excision repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. As expected, these two tumors had high mutation burdens with a high frequency of cytosine to thymine transitions at the 3′ basepairs of consecutive pyrimidines (the classic mutation that arises from UV radiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>). Interestingly, they did not have a high proportion of “signature 7” mutations (a mutational signature extracted from pan-cancer analyses and attributed to UV radiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>). The absence of signature 7 was due to differences in the trinucleotide contexts of mutations arising in wild type versus mutant-<italic toggle="yes">XPC</italic> tumors (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>) and illustrates how the repertoire of known mutational signatures remains incomplete.</p>
          <p id="Par11">Second, there were cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas that arose sporadically in patients with no known comorbidities. These cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas had high mutation burdens, and the majority of mutations were attributable to UV radiation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The most common mutations in these tumors overlapped with mutations recently shown to be enriched in sun-exposed normal skin (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>), further linking UV radiation to their formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p id="Par12">Furthermore, there were two distinct types of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas arising from immunosuppressed patients, who were primarily organ-transplant recipients. As previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas from patients treated with Azathioprine (as a means to prevent transplant rejection) had high mutation burdens with high proportions of signature 32 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Azathioprine increases the risk of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma beyond the risk conferred by other immunosuppressive agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> because Azathioprine is both immunosuppressive and a potent mutagen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Patients on other immunosuppressive drug regimens had comparably lower mutation burdens, primarily attributable to UV radiation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par13">Finally, there were cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas from patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), a rare hereditary disorder characterized by chronic blistering in the skin and caused by germline mutations in collagen VII (<italic toggle="yes">COL7A1</italic>). As previously noted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, these tumors had relatively low mutation burdens, primarily from APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p>

          <title>Nomination of driver mutations in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma</title>

          <p id="Par15">While these tools nominated a relatively small number of genes, the number of genes nominated is in line with our statistical power to detect cancer genes in this study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Specifically, the genes nominated by these tools tended to be mutated in approximately 15% or more of tumors. To nominate driver mutations that were too infrequent to show evidence of positive selection in this dataset alone, we searched for overlapping mutations in the cancerhotspots.org database (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). This database contains mutations identified from pan-cancer analyses that cluster within genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>—a common pattern for gain-of-function mutations.

          <p id="Par16">Finally, we nominated genes with focal copy number alterations. Focal, homozygous deletions affected the <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> tumor suppressor genes (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

          <title>Removal of false positive driver mutations</title>
          <p id="Par17">The earliest generation of algorithms to discover cancer genes assumed a background mutation rate that is uniform across the genome (an assumption that is not true<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>), resulting in the nomination of hundreds of candidate genes in high mutation burden cancers, most of which were large and poorly expressed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. The algorithms, utilized here, have improved background mutation rate models, but the determinants of the mutation rate across the genome are complex and remain incompletely understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, leaving open the possibility of false positives. We curated the nominated genes, as described below, to root out unlikely cancer genes, though we acknowledge that these are ultimately judgment calls.</p>
          <p id="Par18">We concluded that <italic toggle="yes">COL11A1</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) requires additional evidence to be considered a driver gene. <italic toggle="yes">COL11A1</italic> has a borderline significant <italic toggle="yes">q</italic>-value (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2</xref>). One reason why it was nominated was because it had a high number of splice-site mutations; however, it has an unusual gene structure with many small exons, increasing the probability that these mutations could have occurred by random chance. Moreover, <italic toggle="yes">COL11A1</italic> is poorly expressed in the keratinocyte lineage (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref>, see Supplementary Note in the methods for more details on why we removed this gene from consideration).

          <p id="Par19">Finally, we do not believe there is sufficient evidence to classify the hotspot mutation affecting <italic toggle="yes">KNSTRN</italic> as oncogenic. The mutation is annotated as coding, but this appears to be based on an erroneous gene model. From RNA-sequencing data of normal skin and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, expression of <italic toggle="yes">KNSTRN</italic> begins downstream of the mutation site (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5c</xref>), implying that the mutation affects the promoter of <italic toggle="yes">KNSTRN</italic>.

In total, we nominated 30 cancer genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), known to operate in a core set of signaling pathways, that were perturbed in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Our study suggests new cancer genes and helps clarify which candidates from previous studies are likely bona fide driver genes in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.</p>
        <p id="Par32">Future work is still needed to understand the driver genes in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Cancer gene discovery studies have likely reached a saturation point for many cancers, but this is not the case for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Despite the size of our meta-analysis, we could only detect cancer genes with mutations in 15% of more of tumors. We overcame this limitation, in part, by identifying genes with well-characterized hotspot mutations and/or focal copy number alterations; however, there are likely many cancer genes in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma that have yet to be discovered. Our study also focused on the exome, prohibiting us from identifying driver mutations in non-coding regions of the genome or from identifying structural variants and viral integrations that may play a pathogenic role. Finally, as another limitation to this study, future functional and mechanistic studies will be needed to fully understand why and how the genes, discussed here, are under selection to be mutated in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.</p>

Thirteen of these tumors had few, if any, discernible point mutations, and among the point mutations detected, their mutant allele frequencies (MAFs) were close to our detection limit.

Two cases had less than fivefold coverage in the reference tissues, making it difficult to confidently distinguish somatic mutations from germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

In parallel, indels were called using Pindel (v0.2.5) and further filtered.

Finally, we calculated tumor cellularity in each sample, and removed variants that were not predicted to be in at least 40% of tumor cells. The main reason we removed these variants is because it was difficult to distinguish whether they were from subclones within the tumor or from unrelated clones of mutant keratinocytes.

          <title>Calling heterozygous SNPs</title>
          <p id="Par39">We also identified a high-confidence set of germline heterozygous SNPs from the reference bams corresponding to each patient. Knowing these SNPs allowed us to measure allelic imbalance, thereby revealing tumor cellularity (detailed below) and corroborating copy number alterations within tumors. To identify heterozygous, germline SNPs, we called variants in the reference tissue as compared to the reference genome using FreeBayes (v1.3.1). Next, we filtered these variants to include only those that overlapped known 1000 genomes sites and which had 40–60% variant allele frequency.</p>

          <title>Inferring tumor cellularity</title>
          <p id="Par40">We used multiple methods, if possible, to infer the neoplastic cell content from each tumor. The methods used for each tumor are listed in Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref> and further described below.</p>
          <p id="Par41">“<italic toggle="yes">Allelic imbalance of SNPs over deletions</italic>”: We calculated tumor cellularity from the degree of allelic imbalance of heterozygous, germline SNPs over chromosomal arms with deletions in the tumor. This strategy assumes the deletions are fully clonal and there remains only one copy of the remaining chromosome in each tumor cell. A deletion results in a complete loss of an allele within the tumor cells. As a result, sequencing reads from the deleted allele are assumed to come from non-neoplastic cells. Tumor cellularity can therefore be calculated from ratio of reads mapping to the A and B alleles as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p id="Par42">“<italic toggle="yes">Allelic imbalance of SNPs over copy number neutral LOH</italic>”: Similar to the above strategy, we calculated tumor cellularity from the degree of allelic imbalance of heterozygous, germline SNPs over chromosomal arms with copy-number-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH). This strategy assumes that copy number neutral LOH is fully clonal and there are two copies of the remaining allele in each tumor cell. Copy number neutral LOH results in complete loss of an allele within the tumor cells. As a result, sequencing reads mapping to the lost allele are assumed to come from the non-neoplastic cells. Tumor cellularity can therefore be calculated from ratio of reads mapping to the A and B alleles as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p id="Par43">“<italic toggle="yes">Modal somatic MAF</italic>”: In addition to investigating the variant allele frequencies of heterozygous, germline SNPs, we also used the MAFs of somatic mutations. The MAF of a somatic mutation that is fully-clonal and heterozygous should be 50%, but will decrease with stromal contamination. For each tumor, we plotted a histogram of MAFs and determined the “peak” or “modal” MAF, and we doubled these values to infer tumor cellularity.</p>
          <p id="Par44">“<italic toggle="yes">Median Somatic MAF</italic>”: For a small number of tumors, the density of somatic mutations was insufficient to produce a smooth histogram. In these cases, we determined the median MAF from all somatic mutations, and we doubled this value to infer tumor cellularity. If the patient was male, we separately calculated the median MAF of somatic mutations on the sex chromosomes and incorporated these values without doubling.</p>

          <title>Determining statistical power to call somatic mutations (related to Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>)</title>
          <p id="Par45">To identify a somatic mutation, there must be sufficient coverage in both the reference and the tumor. Therefore, for each tumor/reference pair, we calculated the footprint for which sequencing coverage was sufficient to call somatic mutations.</p>
          <p id="Par46">In the reference, sufficient coverage is necessary to detect both alleles, thus ensuring that a variant in the tumor is a somatic mutation and not a germline SNP. We required at least sixfold coverage in the reference to call a somatic mutation. Assuming each allele is randomly sampled during sequencing, the probability of both alleles being sampled at least once with sixfold coverage is 96.9% (two-tailed binomial test). We used the Footprints software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> to calculate the precise number of basepairs that achieved sixfold coverage (or greater) in each reference bam and designated this value as the “call-able” footprint for each reference bam (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par47">In the tumor, there needs to be sufficient coverage to detect the mutant allele. We required our somatic mutation calls to have at least four unique reads. Some mutation callers, including MuTect2, which was used in this study, will attempt to call mutations with fewer reads, but in practice, we found those calls to be of poor quality and filtered them out. We considered a site to be “call-able” if it had eightfold effective tumor coverage. “Effective tumor coverage” refers to the sequencing coverage derived from the tumor after discounting the proportion of reads from non-tumor cells. For example, if a tumor sample has 100-fold total coverage and 8% tumor cellularity, then the effective tumor coverage would be eightfold. Assuming that the alleles are randomly sampled during sequencing, their relative coverages will fit a binomial distribution and eightfold effective tumor coverage is sufficient to call a heterozygous somatic mutation 50% of the time (two-tailed binomial test). We used the Footprints software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> to calculate the precise number of basepairs that achieved eightfold effective tumor coverage or greater in each tumor bam and designated this value as the “call-able” footprint for each tumor bam (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par48">For each tumor/reference pair, we took the minimum “call-able” footprint between the tumor and the reference and designated that value to be the “call-able” footprint for that sample. We subsequently divided the “call-able” footprint by the bait territory that was targeted to indicate the fraction of target basepairs for which we were statistically powered to recognize mutations. These numbers are reported in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>.</p>
          <p id="Par49">There were primarily three variables that reduced statistical power to recognize mutations: 1. Low overall coverage, 2. Low tumor cellularity, 3. Extreme variability in coverage (e.g. from GC-selection biases introduced during hybridization).</p>

          <title>Selecting focal somatic copy number alterations</title>
          <p id="Par52">We filtered the segmented copy number data by amplitude and level of support to create a short list of focal amplifications or deletions. Specifically, we selected amplicons with log2(tumor/reference) values above 0.9 or deep deletions with log2(tumor/reference) values below −1 We also required these segments to have at least 20 supporting probes. We then required amplicons to show evidence of allelic imbalance data to further remove technical artifacts. Finally, we manually curated and have plotted the completed list (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). As part of our manual inspection, when there was more than one gene within a copy number alteration, we nominated the gene we suspected to be the driver of each copy number event. For each gene that was nominated, we revisited copy number data from other samples and identified some additional examples that were previously missed with our filtering criteria—for example, we identified an extremely focal deletion of <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> that was not supported by 20 probes.

          <p id="Par53">When calling somatic point mutations, we only considered mutations that were estimated to be in at least 40% of tumor cells. This was helpful in comparing the mutation burdens from tumors across the different studies for which there was considerable variability in sequencing coverages. High-sequencing coverage permits the detection of subclonal mutations, which would artificially inflate the mutation burden of a tumor, compared to another with lower coverage, if subclonal mutations are counted. There were also differences in our ability to detect clonal mutations in each tumor (described in more detail in the “Determining statistical power to call somatic mutations” section). To address this issue, we divided the number of clonal mutations in each tumor by the footprint which we were statistically powered to detect mutations in each tumor.</p>
          <p id="Par54">To perform mutational signature analysis, surrounding genomic contexts were applied to single-nucleotide variants identified in each clone using the Biostrings hg19 human genome sequence package (BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19 v1.4.0). Variant contexts were used to assess the proportion of each clone’s mutational landscape that could be attributed to a mutagenic process using the deconstructSigs R package (v1.9.0). A set of 48 signatures recently described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> were analyzed. The results of these analyses are shown in the “Signature Proportion” stacked barplot of Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. In parallel, we performed a simpler analysis of dinucleotide contexts to identify cytosine to thymine transitions at the 3′ basepair of dipyrimidines or cytosine–cytosine to thymine–thymine mutations (see the “UV” column of Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">4</xref>)—these are the classic mutation types attributed to UV radiation, and the results are shown in the “Fraction UV Mutations” stacked barplot of Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

This might seem meaningful because splice-site mutations tend to be damaging, but <italic toggle="yes">COL11A1</italic> has an unusual gene structure with a large number of small exons (less than 20 amino acids), increasing the likelihood that a splice-site mutation could occur by random chance. There were very few nonsense or frameshift mutations, which are much more common in bona fide tumor suppressor genes. The cancer gene discovery algorithm which nominated <italic toggle="yes">COL11A1</italic> does not model the possibility that a splice-site mutation could occur by random chance, likely explaining why this gene escaped its filters. However, it is interesting that germline mutations in <italic toggle="yes">COL7A1</italic> cause RDEB, which in turn promotes cSCC, and it is tempting to wonder if somatic mutations in <italic toggle="yes">COL11A1</italic> could also drive cSCC.

          <p id="Par59">We sought to compare the genes nominated in our study to those nominated in previous studies. Previous studies used a variety of methodologies to nominate genes, so we outline, here, precisely how we extracted their gene lists. These genes were classified into two categories—“nominated” or “noted”. A “nominated” gene was typically highlighted in a figure, such as a tiling plot, or a gene list in the results or a table. A “noted” gene tended not reach statistical significance but was either borderline or mentioned as a potential cancer gene at some point in the manuscript.</p>
          <p id="Par60">In the Durinck paper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, we considered genes in the header of Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> as “nominated”.

In the South paper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, we considered genes in the tiling plot of Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> to be “nominated”. The Durinck and South papers were the among the first to perform exome sequencing, and thus their gene lists were curated based on prior biological knowledge. The Cammareri paper’s “nominated” genes were those called with MutSigCV or IntOgen with a <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value of less than 0.05 as shown in Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>, and we considered genes to be “noted” from this study if they were in the tiling plots shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The “nominated” genes from the Chitsazzadeh paper were those listed as significantly mutated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, which was determined by mutations being present in at least seven unique patients, or mutations which have been suggested as a driver in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in prior studies, or mutations with 400 or more frequency hits from the COSMIC database. The Cho paper “nominated” genes with a false discovery rate (<italic toggle="yes">q</italic>-value) of less than 0.001 using MuSiC, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. The Inman paper “nominated” genes featured in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, which were determined if a gene was called by at least two of three cancer discovery tools—the cutoff for MutSig was having a <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> value less than 0.05, and the cutoff for both OncoDrive tools was a <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> value of less than 0.05.
