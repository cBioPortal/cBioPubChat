          <p id="Par1">Improved survival rates for prostate cancer through more effective therapies have also led to an increase in the diagnosis of metastases to infrequent locations such as the brain. Here we investigate the repertoire of somatic genetic alterations present in brain metastases from 51 patients with prostate cancer brain metastases (PCBM). We highlight the clonal evolution occurring in PCBM and demonstrate an increased mutational burden, concomitant with an enrichment of the homologous recombination deficiency mutational signature in PCBM compared to non-brain metastases. Focusing on known pathogenic alterations within homologous recombination repair genes, we find 10 patients (19.6%) fulfilling the inclusion criteria used in the PROfound clinical trial, which assessed the efficacy of PARP inhibitors (PARPi) in homologous recombination deficient prostate cancer. Eight (15.7%) patients show biallelic loss of one of the 15 genes included in the trial, while 5 patients (9.8%) harbor pathogenic alterations in <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1/2</italic> specifically. Uncovering these molecular features of PCBM may have therapeutic implications, suggesting the need of clinical trial enrollment of PCBM patients when evaluating potential benefit from PARPi.</p>

        <p id="Par3">Lethal prostate cancer (PCa) commonly metastasizes to bone, lymph nodes and, less frequently, to visceral organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In the largest survey of over 550 autopsy cases of metastatic PCa, prostate cancer brain metastases (PCBM) were identified in only 1.5% of cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In contrast, brain metastases in other cancers are more common (e.g., 16.3% in lung, 9.8% in renal cell carcinoma, 7.4% in melanoma, or 5% in breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>). Large-scale genomics studies of metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) have revealed the enrichment for <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">AR</italic> alterations in PCa metastases compared to primary disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and the association between <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> mutations and mCRPC outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The recent improvement in systemic therapy for PCa has led to significantly increased patient survival, with average survival extended to about 40 months compared to 15 months with earlier therapies (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>). However, with prolonged survival, oncologists have noted an increased occurrence of PCBM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. We posited that PCBM may require distinct genetic changes that distinguish these tumors from more common PCa metastases. As little is known about the genomic landscape of these rare metastases, we conducted a comprehensive multi-regional genomic analysis of a PCBM cohort of 51 patients, with non-synchronous matched primary samples available for 20 patients.</p>
        <p id="Par4">In this study, we comprehensively assess the genomic features which define PCBM.</p>
        <p id="Par5">In order to provide insights into mutational processes specifically associated with metastasis to the brain we compare primary samples from this cohort to the large scale primary-PCa cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and metastatic PCBM samples to mCPRC from other anatomic sites from the Stand Up to Cancer/Prostate Cancer Foundation castration-resistant prostate cancer cohort (CRPC500)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. For 20 matched cases with both primary and metastatic samples, we identify putative driver genetic events resulting from clonal evolution that could drive metastasis and examine the clonal evolution occurring in cases with multiple intratumoral regions within the primary tumor and PCBM. We further compare pathways affected by genetic alterations in patients harboring parenchymal brain metastases with those presenting dural metastases in order better to understand the processes which may determine the specific site of metastasis.</p>

          <title>Demographic and clinical data of the PCBM cohort</title>
          <p id="Par6">The cohort of 51 patients analyzed here (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), represents a substantial increase in the number of PCBM samples over existing studies. (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The average age at the time of PCBM diagnosis among the 51 patients was 71 years. 56% (29/52) harbored multiple and 41% (21/51) singular CNS metastasis. Metastases in brain parenchyma were present in 41% (21/51), dural metastases in 35% (18/51) while in 24% (12/51) of the patients the primarily metastatic location was either unknown or unclear by involvement of multiple anatomical structures. Additionally, 88% (45/51) of the patients presented non-brain metastases with bone involvement in 91% (41/45) of these. Androgen deprivation therapy or orchiectomy were conducted in 82% (42/51) of the cases. From those, 26% (11/42) underwent further therapy with next-generation ARSi (androgen receptor signaling inhibitors), namely abiraterone and/or enzalutamide (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>

          <title>Histomorphology of primary tumors and brain metastases</title>
          <p id="Par7">We first reviewed the histomorphology across the PCBM cohort. Pure acinar adenocarcinoma histology was identified in 48/51 (94%) PCBM and in 20/20 (100%) primary PCa. In 2/20 (10%) of the primary PCa samples, we also identified focal neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation by IHC. The remaining 3/51 (6%) PCBM showed either areas of small cell NE carcinoma admixed with acinar adenocarcinoma (observed in patient P27), or features intermediate between NE carcinoma and acinar adenocarcinoma (patients P1 and P33)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This distribution of morphologic phenotypes is similar to a recent study by Abida et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> where 89% of CRPC cases were classified as adenocarcinoma and 11% showed NE features. The majority of primary PCa contained high-grade areas consisting of ISUP-Grade Group 5 (15/20; 75%). The remaining cases were Grade Group 4 (2/20; 10%) or Grade Group 3 (1/20; 5%), while two tumors were not gradable. When enough tissue was available, we performed IHC analysis for protein expression of frequently altered genes in PCa (ERG, p53, and PTEN) to identify tumor heterogeneity. Based on the morphology and immunohistochemical profile, one or more intratumoral regions of interest (ROIs) were defined and sampled for subsequent genomic investigation (WES/targeted RNA), totaling 168 samples (105 from PCBM, 63 from primary PCa) from 51 patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Summary of histologic and genetic alterations in prostate cancer brain metastases.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Histology and immunohistochemistry results, <bold>b</bold> Summary of non-synonymous mutations/Mb. <bold>c</bold> Relative contribution of mutational signatures from COSMIC. <bold>d</bold> Summary of genes showing recurrent mutation or fusion (altered in &gt;5 patients) from WES and targeted RNA-seq data.

          <title>The genetic landscape of PCBM</title>
          <p id="Par8">Across the 168 samples, we detected an average of 4.43 coding alterations/Mb, including SNVs and indels (range 0.28–50.45). We detected an average of 2.98 SNVs/Mb (range 0.22–38.21), 0.49 deletions/Mb (range 0–10.22) and 0.15 insertions/Mb (range 0–2.02). Significantly more SNVs, insertions and deletions, were detected in PCBM compared to the matched primaries (SNVs <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 6.75 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, insertions <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 3.06 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, deletions <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 9.30 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, Wilcoxon test) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a, b</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par9">We found significantly higher levels of SNVs, insertions and deletions in the primary samples of PCBM cohort compared to TCGA (SNVs <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 1.21 × 10<sup>−22</sup>, insertions <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 1.58 × 10<sup>−3</sup> and deletions <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 5.67 × 10<sup>−10</sup>, Wilcoxon test). As the primary PCa from PCBM cohort were mainly high grade (ISUP-Grade Group, GG &gt; 3), we performed the same comparison using the high grade (GG &gt; 3) TCGA samples and found similar enrichment for all alteration types in the PCa of PCBM cohort (SNV <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 8.78 × 10<sup>−18</sup>, insertions <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 4.03 × 10<sup>−2</sup> and deletions 2.19 × 10<sup>−7</sup>, Wilcoxon test) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>). Comparing coding alterations in PCBM against the CRPC500 showed a significant enrichment for somatic alterations compared to non-brain metastases (SNVs <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 2.38 × 10<sup>−19</sup>, insertions <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 2.82 × 10<sup>−15</sup> and deletions <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 8.44 × 10<sup>−14</sup>, Wilcoxon test) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a, b</xref>). These differences persisted after two analyses examining the effect of different sequencing depths across cohorts, first by applying more stringent alternate allele read thresholds (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>), and secondly by simulating the effects of downsampling our sequencing data (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>). We also observed the same enrichments when making these comparisons using only the cases for which we had matched normal tissue (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c</xref>). This confirmed that the differences in detected mutations are not as a result of different sequencing depths between cohorts, or the inclusion of samples without a matched normal.</p>
          <p id="Par10">The average total coding mutation rate across the whole cohort was below 15 mutations/Mb for all but four patients (patients P39, P58 P48, and P55) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Patients P39, P58, and P48 had high representation of the SBS44 (defective DNA mismatch repair) Single Base Substitution (SBS) signature. Of the three samples with high representation of SBS44, samples from patients P39 and P48 harbored missense and frameshift mutations, respectively, in <italic toggle="yes">MSH2</italic> and both showed high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) status using a clinical molecular diagnostic assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Samples from patient P58 had a frameshift variant in <italic toggle="yes">POLD1</italic> and a missense variant in <italic toggle="yes">RFC4</italic>, and those from patient P55 harbored missense variants in <italic toggle="yes">POL3RC</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">RNMT</italic>, but no alteration affecting an MMR or HRR gene.

          <title>Clonal evolution in PCBM</title>
          <p id="Par16">The 20 cases for which we had both primary and metastatic samples provide a unique opportunity to study the clonal evolution occurring in primary prostate cancers which metastasized to the brain, and in the metastases themselves. Most other studies of CRPC have only rarely had more than a few non-synchronous, matched primary and metastatic samples to explore. Furthermore, given the inclusion of patients with both dural and parenchymal metastases, these samples allow us to interrogate the nature of the clonal evolution specific to each of these locations. Therefore, using the cancer cell fraction (CCF) estimates for synonymous and non-synonymous SNVs from ABSOLUTE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and PhylogicNDT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, we examined clonal evolution within and between samples from the primary and metastatic sites. We calculated clusters of mutations in each patient, and the CCF of these clusters in each patient sample from all 20 cases. Furthermore, we were able to generate clonal evolution trees from 14 of these patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–d</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>).

          <p id="Par17">In 18/20 cases we observed the expansion of clones from subclonal in the primary samples, to a clonal level (CCF &gt; 0.9) in the metastatic samples (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). We highlight the clonal evolution occurring in two patients with dural and two with parenchymal metastases in detail (patients P4 and P14, and P5 and P8, respectively) <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–d</xref>). In samples from patient P4, which had truncal mutations in <italic toggle="yes">ZFHX3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">POU2F</italic>, cluster 2 (light blue) mutations became clonal in all three metastatic samples, and cluster 4 (expanded to a clonal level in sample M2 only (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>)). In patient P14, samples from which did not show a truncal mutation in a driver gene, cluster 4 (dark green) showed an increasing cellular fraction across primary samples (sample P1 0.19, P2 0.36, P3 0.76) and expanded to become clonal in metastatic samples M2 and M3 (CCF 0.95), and near clonal in M1 (CCF 0.86) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). From these clones, cluster 5 (light purple), which emerged at a subclonal level in sample P3 (CCF 0.54), expanded to become clonal in sample M2, and to a near clonal level in samples M1 and M3 (CCF 0.83 and 0.88 respectively). Cluster 7 (light green), similarly expanded to become clonal in M2 and M3 (CCF 0.95, 0.97 respectively) and near clonal in M1 (CCF 0.86). Interestingly, in this patient, clones with a cluster of mutations (cluster 6, dark red) present at a clonal level in samples P2 and P3 were not present at a high CCF in the metastatic samples (CCFs M1 0.15, M2 0.05, and M3 0.05), but evolved a further clonal cluster (cluster 8, pink) of mutations in primary samples P1 and P3.</p>
          <p id="Par18">The representative samples from patients with parenchymal metastases (patients P5 and P8) demonstrated similar clonal evolutionary processes as seen in the dural metastases. Patient P5 showed no truncal mutation in a common driver gene (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), while samples from patient P8 harbored truncal mutations in <italic toggle="yes">CDK12</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">EPHA2</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">KMT2C</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). In patient P5, cluster 2 was present at a clonal level (CCF 0.96) in primary sample P1, and at lower CCFs (0.27 and 0.35) in primary samples P2 and P3. Clones with this cluster of mutations were, however, clonal or near-clonal in all three metastatic samples (CCF M1 0.88, M2 0.92, M3, 0.97), suggesting the metastases may have arisen from clones present at the region from which the P1 sample was taken. Interestingly, we observed a branching event stemming from these clones, with clones harboring cluster 3 and 6 mutations becoming clonal in metastatic samples M1 and M2 (CCF M1 1.00, M2 0.98). In metastatic sample M3, however, these mutations were only present at a CCF of 0.01, whereas clones containing cluster 3 and cluster 7 mutations, which included an <italic toggle="yes">ASXL2</italic> variant, expanded to a clonal level (CCF 0.99). Similarly, in patient P8, clones with cluster 3 and 4 mutations became clonal in all three metastatic samples (CCF cluster 3 M1 1.00, M2 1.00, M3 1.00, cluster 4 M1 1.00, M2 1.00, M3 1.00) and, in which further mutations were acquired (cluster 6) which expanded to a clonal level in sample M1 only (CCF M1 1.00, M2 0.50, M3 0.02).</p>
          <p id="Par19">These cases, along with the other ten for which we were able to obtain multiple intrametastatic samples, demonstrate the heterogeneity present in the metastases. For example, in patient P14 cluster 10 was present at CCFs of 0.27, 0.02, and 0.79 in samples M1, M2, and M3, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), while the metastatic samples from patient P9 showed the emergence of a clonal cluster of mutations in samples M1 and M3 (cluster 6), which was not present in sample M2, where instead cells with cluster 8 mutations were present at a clonal level (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9b</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par20">In the literature, the few PCBM that have been studied are mostly tumors associated with the dura which have not invaded into the brain parenchyma. Given that we observed both dural and parenchymal metastases in our cohort, we asked if there were any genetic differences between these tumors, positing that parenchymal metastases may have gained additional driver mutations as compared to the dural metastases. We investigated the genes with mutations in clusters which became clonal in the metastases from the 20 patients from whom we had primary and metastatic samples. These genes were highly enriched for factors involved in calcium signaling including mutations affecting the EP300 paralog <italic toggle="yes">CREBP</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10a</xref>). We also found enrichment for genes involved in the FAT10 cancer signaling pathway (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10b</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par21">We further explored these metastatic-clonal genes and found that they were significantly associated with networks related to processes including DNA replication, recombination and repair, and neurological disease (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). We then performed the same comparison, after dividing the metastatic-clonal genes based on the dural or parenchymal metastatic location as an exploratory analysis to dissect the mechanisms which are most frequently affected by genetic alterations in the different metastatic locations. This comparison was carried out on a limited number of samples (nine dural, ten parenchymal) in order to explore the possibility of any differences between the two sites.</p>
          <p id="Par22">Following correction for multiple testing, metastatic-clonal genes in the parenchymal metastases showed enrichment for genes involved in calcium signaling and ‘regulation of EMT in development’ (<italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.013 and <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.02, respectively). Metastatic-clonal genes in the dural metastases, however, were enriched for factors associated with aldosterone signaling in epithelial cells (<italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.047) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>). Still considering the specific metastatic site (dural or parenchymal), we asked whether these metastatic-clonal genes fell under the influence of a particular upstream regulator. Following correction for multiple testing we found no enrichment for genes under a particular regulator being altered in the parenchymal metastases, but observed a trend towards enrichment for genes regulated by the long noncoding RNA mir17HG (<italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.07). Similarly, in the dural metastases we observed a trend towards enrichment for genes regulated by the polycomb repressive complex subunit EZH2 (<italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.07), a well described epigenetic driver of prostate cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>). While the nature of these interactions remains to be defined, these data suggest particular mechanisms which may drive the metastasis of prostate cancer to the dura or parenchyma, which may be regulated by epigenetic or tumor microenvironmental factors that were not assessed.</p>
          <p id="Par23">These data show the heterogeneity present in PCBM and support a model of clonal selection in the metastatic setting, along with continued clonal evolution occurring in the primary tumor after metastasis has occurred. While further data are needed better to understand the different mechanisms driving dural or parenchymal metastasis, the enrichment for calcium and FAT10 signaling in these metastases in general suggest possible mechanisms driving metastasis to the brain. Furthermore, the affected networks reiterate the potential importance of altered DNA damage repair pathways in PCBM.</p>

        <p id="Par24">As improvements in prostate cancer survival have allowed an increase in metastases to less common metastatic sites, we investigated the genetic landscape of PCBM in comparison to non-brain metastases, to better understand the processes associated with this particular disease progression.</p>
        <p id="Par25">We observed an increased level of somatic alterations in the PCBM compared to the CRPC500 cohort of non-brain prostate cancer metastases, along with an increased frequency of PROfound-gene alteration, with biallelic inactivation of at least one of these genes detected in 8/51 (15.7%) patients. Given this, we compared the presence of the HRD mutational signature in the PCBM and CRPC500 cohorts. Importantly, and in line with a recent study on the mutational signatures present in brain metastases from colorectal cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, we observed a significant enrichment for the mutational signature of HRD (as detected by SigMA) in PCBM compared to non-brain metastases. Moreover, a significant enrichment of the HRD signature was also present in the primaries of PCBM compared to a high-grade subset of PCA in the TCGA-cohort. Given its enrichment in the primaries of PCBM compared to TCGA, the presence of HRD signature may serve as a useful risk stratification biomarker for metastatic PCa progression to the brain. It is important to note that, in 24/51 patients, no matched normal tissue was available, so mutations were called against a pooled normal. However, steps were taken to prevent inflating the number of mutations, and results retained significance when considering only cases for which matched normal tissue was available.</p>
        <p id="Par26">The PROfound phase 3 trial demonstrated prolonged overall survival in the cohort of patients with mCRPC and pathogenic alterations affecting <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2,</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">ATM</italic> as well as benefits in the overall trial population with alterations in any of the PROfound genes when treated with the PARP inhibitor olaparib after progression on enzalutamide or abiraterone. However, while PARPi, such as Olaparib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> or niraparib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, have been shown to be active on brain metastases in patients with HRD breast cancer and in murine models of brain metastases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, patients with known brain metastases were excluded from the PROfound trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. We detected pathogenic alterations meeting the criteria for the PROfound trial in 10/51 (19.6%) patients in the PCBM cohort, with five (9.8%) patients harboring qualifying alterations in <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic>.</p>
        <p id="Par27">This study, therefore, suggests that a relevant proportion of men with PCBM may benefit from PARPi given the high frequency of HRR alterations, the prevalence of the HRD signature and the presence of pathogenic molecular events in the PROfound genes.</p>
        <p id="Par28">The 20 cases for which primary and metastatic samples were available allowed us to investigate the clonal evolution occurring in PCBM, while the inclusion of patients with both dural and parenchymal metastases allowed comparison of the processes which may drive metastases to these specific sites. In keeping with a model of selection of particular subclones in the metastatic niche<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> we observed both heterogeneity in the different regions and clonal expansion in PCBM, particularly involving genes related to calcium signaling and FAT10 signaling. The genes associated with calcium signaling included EP300 paralog CREBP which regulates genes involved in cell growth in prostate cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, while those associated with the FAT10 pathway included genes such as the high mobility group gene <italic toggle="yes">TCF7L2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CTNNB1</italic>, known to regulate processes such as cell migration and metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. While the genes with mutations which became clonal in the dural metastases were enriched for molecules involved in aldosterone signaling, and possibly regulation by EZH2, we observed enrichment in parenchymal brain metastases for genes involved in the same calcium signaling pathway as was enriched in the set of all metastatic-clonal genes, along with genes involved in developmental EMT. While these data are not conclusive, they suggest the importance of alterations to these pathways in parenchymal brain metastases. The enrichment for alterations affecting mir17HG is also a potential link between parenchymal metastases and HRD as, in concert with SIRT1, this long noncoding RNA has been suggested to promote double-strand DNA break repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. This, along with the putative enrichment for genes regulated by EZH2 may, alternatively, suggest that epigenetic or microenvironmental alterations could also explain this propensity.</p>
        <p id="Par29">These observations may serve as a starting point for more in-depth investigation into the processes driving metastasis to the brain in particular. Furthermore, the enrichment for the clonal expansion of mutations affecting genes involved in DNA repair, highlights the association between defective DNA repair and PCBM, identified by our analysis of the mutational signatures prevalent in PCBM cohort, and the frequency of alterations affecting HRR genes.</p>
        <p id="Par30">Taken together, the enrichment for HRD mutational signature and for HRR alteration (HRD mutational signature and PROfound-gene alterations) in PCBM compared to non-brain PCa metastases suggests that HRD is a salient characteristic of PCBM. In addition, given its enrichment in the primaries of PCBM compared to TCGA, the HRD signature may be a useful risk stratification biomarker for metastatic PCa progression to the brain. Finally, the detection of well documented pathogenic events in HRR in a significant subset of PCBM cohort and together with the benefits patients with such alterations shown to Olaparib therapy in PROfound, would support a potential role for PARP-inhibitor therapy in a population of men who were not included in the PROfound clinical trial.</p>

          <p id="Par33">All tissue slides (HE and IHC) were scanned and uploaded in CaseCenter (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ngtma.path.unibe.ch/casecenter/">http://ngtma.path.unibe.ch/casecenter/</ext-link>). Through the digital microscope application CaseViewer, the slides were reviewed and annotated for further core biopsy punching. Morphological and immunohistochemical assessment was done by ARC and supervised by a board-certified pathologist (MAR). Based on the morphology, we assessed the presence of different Gleason patterns, intraductal carcinoma, ductal histology, and neuroendocrine differentiation. For each specimen, we selected representative blocks to best recapitulate the heterogeneity of the above features. IHC stains were performed on all selected blocks after first review. Cases with limited amount of tissue were assessed only morphologically. For each case, p53 (clone DO‐7; Dako-Agilent; 1:800) PTEN (clone 6H2.1; Cascade Bioscience; 1:400) and ERG (clone EP111; Dako-Agilent; 1:50) were stained. Additionally, if neuroendocrine features were present, Chromogranin-A (clone DAK‐A3; Dako-Agilent; 1:1600), Synaptophysin (clone 27G12; BioSystems; 1:100) and PSA (polyclonal; Dako-Agilent; 1:4000) were added, as were CK5/6 (clone D5/16B4; Merck; 1:4000) and p63 (clone 7JUL; BioSystems; 1:40) for suspected intraductal carcinoma. Finally, by combining morphological and immunohistochemical features, we identified and selected up to three heterogeneous Regions of interest (ROIs) within primary tumors and metastases. In cases showing homogeneous morphological and immunohistochemical features throughout all examined slides, up to three tumor areas were randomly selected.</p>

Quality and quantity were determined by real-time PCR (Agilent NGS FFPE QC Kit). 10–200 ng of DNA underwent library preparation and exome capture using the SureSelect<sup>XT</sup> low input protocol with Human All Exon V7 (Agilent) as per manufacturer’s guidelines.

Local realignment, duplicate removal, and base quality adjustment were performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, v4.1) and Picard (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>). Somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels) were detected using Mutect2 (GATK 4.1.4.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and Strelka2 v2.9.10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Only variants detected by both methods were reported. We filtered out SNVs and indels outside the target regions (i.e. exons), those with a variant allelic fraction (VAF) of &lt;5% and/or those supported by &lt;3 reads. We excluded variants for which the tumor VAF was &lt;5 times that of the paired non-tumor VAF, as well as those found at &gt;5% global minor allele frequency of dbSNP (build 137). We further excluded variants identified in at least two of a panel of 210 non-tumor samples, including the non-tumor samples included in the current study, captured and sequenced using the same protocols using the artifact detection mode of Mutect2 implemented in GATK. For samples for which we had no matched normal tissue, we also removed variants present at VAF of &gt; 0.1% in the ExAC non-TCGA database of normal germline samples. All indels were manually inspected using the Integrative Genomics Viewer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Hotspot missense mutations were annotated using the published resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p id="Par40">We carried out two analyses of the effect of differences in sequencing depth between cohorts used in this study, by adjusting the thresholds for alternate allele reads, and by simulating downsampling of our sequencing data. The minimum of one supporting read in TCGA (sequenced to ~100X) is equivalent to ~2.6 reads at our sequencing depth. Similarly, the minimum of ten supporting reads in CRPC500 (sequenced to ~160X) is equivalent to ~16 reads at our sequencing depth. We, therefore, carried out an analysis of our variants using the most stringent combination of thresholds used across these cohorts (i.e., VAF 5% and supported by at least 16 reads) and compared the observed TMB between studies.</p>
          <p id="Par41">To examine the effect of overall sequencing depth on variant calling, we performed a second analysis to simulate the effect of downsampling of our sequencing data to depths (~258X) comparable to TCGA and CRPC500 (the lower being ~100X). Given our current VAF (5%) and supporting read (&gt;3) thresholds, these thresholds would have to be multiplied by 2.6 (~258X/~100X) to simulate the effect of downsampling our ~258X PCBM data to ~100X. This resulted in new thresholds of 12.9% VAF, and a depth threshold of eight alternate allele reads which were used to filter called variants before repeating the comparison of TMB between studies. Data were converted to maf format using maftools and visualized using ggplot2 and ComplexHeatmap in R version 3.6.1. TCGA data were downloaded using TCGAbiolinks.</p>

          <title>Allele-specific copy number analysis</title>
          <p id="Par42">Allele-specific copy number alterations were identified using FACETS (v0.5.6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, which performs joint segmentation of the total and allelic copy ratios and infers purity, ploidy, and allele-specific copy number states. Copy number states were collapsed to the gene level using the median values to coding gene resolution based on all coding genes retrieved from the Ensembl (release GRCh38).</p>
          <p id="Par43">Genes with total copy number greater than gene-level median ploidy were considered gains; greater than ploidy + 4, amplifications; less than ploidy, losses; and total copy number of 0, homozygous deletions. Somatic mutations associated with the loss of the wild-type allele (i.e., loss of heterozygosity [LOH]) were identified as those where the lesser (minor) copy number state at the locus was 0. For chromosome X, the log ratio relative to ploidy was used to call deletions, loss, gains, and amplifications. All mutations on chromosome X in male patients were considered to be associated with LOH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

Results from both methods were averaged. To increase robustness when running deconstructSigs, the mutations for each sample were bootstrapped 100 times and the mean weights across these 100 iterations were used. Sensitive calling of SBS3 (HRD) alone was subsequently performed using SigMA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, which uses a multivariate analysis to detect the presence of SBS3. The score from this was used in comparisons between datasets, along with a thresholded call of signature presence based on the ‘pass_mva_strict’ annotation from this analysis.

          <title>Clonality of single nucleotide variants</title>
          <p id="Par45">Clonal prevalence analysis was conducted using the hierarchical Bayesian model PyClone, and the ABSOLUTE V2.0 algorithm in the case of samples used in analysis of clonal evolution. PyClone estimates the cellular prevalence of mutations in deeply sequenced samples, using allelic counts, and infers clonal structure by clustering these mutations into groups with co-varying cellular frequency. PyClone was run using a two-pass approach, whereby mutations whose cellular prevalence estimate had standard deviation &gt;0.3 were removed before a second pass analysis was run. A cellular prevalence of &gt;80% was used as a threshold for clonality. ABSOLUTE infers CCF from the reads supporting the reference/alternative allele, in conjunction with segmented copy-number data from WES, and was run after patching as described here: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/PhylogicNDT/issues/4#issuecomment-555588341">https://github.com/broadinstitute/PhylogicNDT/issues/4#issuecomment-555588341</ext-link>.
