          <p id="P3">The evolutionary processes that drive universal therapeutic resistance in adult patients with diffuse glioma remain unclear<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Here, we analyzed temporally separated DNA sequencing data and matched clinical annotation from 222 patients with glioma. Through mutational and copy number analyses across the three major subtypes of diffuse glioma, we observed that driver genes detected at initial disease were retained at recurrence, while there was little evidence of recurrence-specific gene alterations. Treatment with alkylating-agents resulted in a hypermutator phenotype at different rates across glioma subtypes, and hypermutation was not associated with differences in survival. Acquired aneuploidy was frequently detected in recurrent gliomas characterized by presence of an IDH mutation but without 1p/19q codeletion and further converged with acquired cell cycle alterations and poor outcomes. We show that the clonal architecture of each tumor remains similar over time and that absence of clonal selection was associated with increased survival. Finally, we did not observe differences in immunoediting levels between initial and recurrent glioma. Our results collectively argue that the strongest selective pressures occur early during glioma development and that current therapies shape this evolution in a largely stochastic manner.</p>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
        <p id="P4">Diffuse glioma is the most common malignant brain tumor in adults and invariably relapse despite treatment with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The molecular landscape of glioma at diagnosis has been extensively characterized <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. While these efforts have led to the identification of driver genes and clinically relevant subtypes<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, it is unknown how the glioma genetic landscape evolves over time and in response to therapy.</p>
        <p id="P5">Intratumoral heterogeneity is a well-recognized characteristic of gliomas and results from selective pressures such as a limited availability of nutrients, clonal competition, and treatment<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Tumors are thought to circumvent these growth bottlenecks via dynamic competition of subclones resulting in the most favorable environment for tumor sustenance<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Recent studies have suggested that stochastic changes in clone frequency (i.e. neutral evolution) and immunogenic surveillance may further contribute to the observed intratumoral heterogeneity<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. An understanding of evolutionary dynamics at multiple time points is needed to develop strategies aimed at delaying or preventing the onset of tumor progression.</p>
        <p id="P6">To investigate clonal dynamics over time and in response to therapeutic pressures, we established the Glioma Longitudinal Analysis (GLASS) Consortium. GLASS is a community-driven effort that seeks to overcome the logistical challenges in constructing adequately powered longitudinal genomic glioma datasets by pooling datasets from patients treated at institutions worldwide <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. We have analyzed longitudinal profiles across the three molecular glioma subtypes to identify the molecular processes active at initial and recurrent time points. These analyses identified few common features of glioma evolution across subtypes, and instead pointed toward highly variable and patient-specific trajectories of genomic alterations.</p>

        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <sec id="S3">
          <title>GLASS cohort</title>
          <p id="P7">We pooled existing and newly generated longitudinal DNA sequencing datasets from 288 patients treated at 35 hospitals (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). After applying quality filters, tumor samples from 222 patients with high-quality data in at least two time points were classified according to molecular markers into three major glioma subtypes: 1. IDH-mutant and chromosome 1p/19q co-deleted (IDHmutant-codel; n = 25) 2. IDH-mutant without chromosome 1p/19q codeletion (IDHmutant-noncodel; n = 63) and 3. IDH wild type (IDHwt; n = 134), in alignment with the World Health Organization classification of Central Nervous System tumors <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. For each patient we selected two time-separated tumor samples, henceforth initial and recurrence, for further analysis.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="S4">
          <title>Mutational burdens and processes over time</title>
          <p id="P8">We first evaluated temporal changes in mutational burden and processes to understand general patterns of glioma evolution. Mutation burdens in initial tumors were comparable with previously reported rates <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. 2.20 mutations (single-nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions) per Megabase (Mutations/Mb) for IDHmutant-codels; 2.52 Mutations/Mb for IDHmutant-noncodels; and 2.85 Mutations/Mb for IDHwt glioma (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). Excluding DNA hypermutation cases (&gt; 10 Mutations/Mb, n = 35), the mutation burden increased after recurrence in 70% of the cohort (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). To study changes during tumor progression, we separated mutations into three fractions: initial only, recurrence only, or shared. Interestingly, private fraction but not shared fraction mutation burdens were comparable between subtypes (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). Patient age at diagnosis was significantly associated with the shared mutational burden and to a lesser extent the mutation burden private to the initial tumor (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). On average, tumors with longer time to recurrence had slightly higher mutation burdens (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P9">These fraction-specific differences in mutation burden suggested that the activity of distinct mutational processes may also be time-dependent. We therefore classified mutations in each fraction according to the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) signature database<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. As expected, signature activity was closely related to subtype and fraction (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). Signature 1 (aging) was nearly always the dominant signature amongst shared mutations in IDHwt tumors, whereas the shared fraction in IDHmut-noncodel and IDHmut-codel tumors - tumor subtypes associated with a younger age of diagnosis - additionally showed a strong presence of signature 16 (unknown etiology). Signatures 3 (double strand break repair) and 15 (mismatch repair) along with signature 8 (unknown etiology) were mostly confined to the private fractions, suggesting that these processes were of lesser importance to tumor maintenance than those associated with aging.</p>
          <p id="P10">Treatment of glioma includes alkylating agents that can induce post-treatment hypermutation<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. We observed enrichment of the associated signature 11 in recurrent tumors with a mutational load exceeding 10 Mutations/Mb and treated with alkylating agents (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>). Treatment-associated hypermutation occurred most frequently among IDHmutant-noncodels (47%), followed by IDHmutant-codels (25%), and IDHwt gliomas (16%) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). The difference in the proportion of hypermutation events was significantly different between the three glioma subtypes (Fisher’s exact-test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 2.0e-03), suggesting that IDHmutant noncodels are most sensitive to developing a hypermutator phenotype <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p id="P11">Treatment-induced hypermutation has been associated with disease progression<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. We did not find overall survival differences between alkylating agent-treated hypermutators and alkylating agent-treated non-hypermutators independent of age, subtype, and <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> methylation status (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2a</xref>-<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">b</xref>). In order to further assess the pathogenicity of acquired mutations, we studied their clonality<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Newly acquired clonal mutations have penetrated most of the tumor (i.e., a selective sweep) between initial and recurrence and mark clonal expansion <sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Conversely, acquired subclonal mutations are less prevalent, and therefore less likely to drive disease progression. Previous reports have suggested that alkylating agent-associated mutations hypermutation are frequently clonal<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. We found that in 48% of hypermutated tumors a majority of the recurrence-only mutations were clonal, potentially reflecting cases where a selective sweep occurred (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). However, IDHmut-noncodel hypermutators with predominantly clonal mutations did not show differences in survival compared with those harboring predominantly subclonal mutations (log-rank test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.38, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>). Alkylating agents such as temozolomide prolong survival of adult patients with glioma<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Our results show that treatment-induced hypermutation is common across subtypes and does not associate with a reduced overall survival supporting the noted benefit of alkylating agent therapy.</p>

          <title>Selective pressures during glioma evolution</title>
          <p id="P12">Environmental and treatment-induced pressures may drive changes in clonal architecture at recurrence. To evaluate selection over time we clustered copy number changes and mutations based on their cancer cell fraction (CCF). CCF values represent the fraction of cancer cells harboring a given alteration and reflect the relative timing of events, since alterations that are present in a subset of cancer cells likely occurred later than events present in all cancer cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Most tumors (84%) demonstrated a mutational cluster with CCF &gt; 50% that persisted from the initial tumor into recurrence, likely reflecting the tumor trunk and harboring the tumor-initiating driver mutations (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. To determine changes in clonal dominance over time we ranked clusters within each sample by their CCF and found similarities in clonal architecture throughout the course of disease (Kendall rank correlation, tau = 0.20, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 3.76E-24, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>-<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). These results suggested that the clonal structure at initial disease mostly persisted into recurrence.</p>
          <p id="P13">To deepen our assessment of selective pressures, we evaluated selection in initial and recurrent tumors by determining the normalized ratio between non-synonymous and synonymous mutations (dNdScv). Higher ratios (&gt; 1) suggest positive selection, and ratios less than one suggest negative selection . We found evidence for positive selection at both time points despite differences between subtypes (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Separating mutations into mutational fractions demonstrated that shared but not private mutations showed positive dN/dS ratios in all three glioma subtypes indicating that only shared mutations (including truncal mutations) are likely subject to positive selection (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). The dN/dS ratio of initial-only mutations showed that these are neither positively nor negatively selected for, while recurrence-only mutations were subject to negative selection in IDHwt.</p>
          <p id="P14">To verify the reduced selective pressure in the private mutations we used an orthogonal method to test for evidence of selection (neutralitytestr)<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. The method uses variant allele frequency distributions and estimated mutation rates to detect whether profiles significantly deviate from a model of neutral evolution (i.e. as depicted by a linear relationship in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). In accordance with dNdScv results, private mutations demonstrated dynamics consistent with neutral evolution (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Shared subclonal mutations deviated from linearity and were consistent with selection both in non-hypermutators and hypermutators (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>-<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">b</xref>), providing additional evidence that the strongest selective forces occur early in gliomagenesis.</p>
          <p id="P15">Cohort-level analysis of selection masks the heterogeneity that exists in individual evolutionary trajectories. To determine the selective effects at each tumor time point we used a Bayesian framework (SubClonalSelection) which simultaneously provides sample-specific probabilities for both selection and neutrality while modeling sources of noise in sequencing data. The classification of a sample as “selection” or “neutral” is determined by whichever model has the greater probability. Classification as “neutral” reflects the accumulation of random mutations that are not subject to selection. Given the stringent algorithm requirements, 183 patients were included in this analysis with at least one time point, and 104 patients with both time points (16 IDHmutant-codels, 29 IDHmutant-noncodels, 59 IDHwt, <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Neutral to neutral was the most common evolutionary trajectory across all three subtypes (52%), and IDHwt tumors displayed the highest observed selection at any time point with selection detected in 64% of tumors (Fisher’s exact test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.01, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>, <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). IDHwt gliomas with evidence for selection at recurrence had a shorter overall survival than IDHwt gliomas classified as neutral at recurrence (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 2.7E-02; log-rank statistic, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>), suggesting that subclonal competition associates with more aggressive tumor behavior. To address the limitations of smaller sample sizes in the IDH-mutant subtypes, we performed a Cox proportional hazards model including age at first diagnosis, all three glioma subtypes, and mode of selection at recurrence. This analysis revealed that selection at recurrence was significantly associated with shorter survival across subtypes (HR = 1.53 95% CI 1.00–2.41, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 4.8E-02, <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). We next investigated whether radiation and chemotherapy imposed a selective effect, by comparing the evolutionary status at recurrence with treatment and other clinical variables. We did not observe significant associations between subclonal selection and radiation therapy or chemotherapy (Fisher’s exact-test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &gt; 0.05, <xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>), suggesting that standard therapeutic approaches for glioma have limited impact on the subclonal tumor architecture. While high-depth sequencing datasets may be required to detect subtle selective effects<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, our analyses raise the possibility that the survival benefit derived from standard chemoradiation results from tumor cell elimination where treatment sensitivity of individual cells is not determined by genetic factors.</p>

          <title>Driver alteration frequencies across time</title>
          <p id="P16">We evaluated how stability, acquisition, and loss of mutation and copy number drivers<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> over time impact glioma evolution. We used dNdScv to nominate 12 candidate mutation driver genes at both time points (<italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> &lt; 0.05, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>) and determined significant copy number alterations that recapitulated previously identified drivers (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>). Mutations in <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic> and co-occurring 1p/19q chromosome-arm loss have been suggested as glioma-initiating events<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, which was corroborated by the observation that these events were never lost or acquired during the surgical interval (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>). Similarly, we observed that <italic toggle="yes">TERT</italic> promoter mutations were almost always shared in the IDHmutant-codel and IDHwt, though many samples lacked sufficient coverage in this GC-rich region. Chromosome 7 gains and chromosome 10 losses were present in a large majority of IDHwt initial tumors and persisted into recurrence.</p>
          <p id="P17">Shifts in the fraction of cancer cells harboring an event may also indicate a time dependency of drivers. We determined changes in cellular prevalence of shared driver events by ordering events in each sample by their CCF (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">ATRX</italic> mutations in IDHmutant-noncodel initial tumors demonstrated lower CCFs than <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.03) and <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.10) mutations, suggesting <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations precede <italic toggle="yes">ATRX</italic> inactivation<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. There was no difference in CCF between <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> amongst initial gliomas (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.98), however, <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic> mutations demonstrated significantly lower CCFs compared with <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0018) in recurrent gliomas. We did not observe any CCF differences among driver mutations detected in IDHwt tumors at either time point. Chromosome 10 deletion CCFs were higher compared to chromosome 7 amplifications (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0036) implying that chromosome 10 deletions arise earlier <sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Similarly, there was no difference in CCF between <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> deletion and <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> amplification (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.70). <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> and chromosomal arm events significantly differed (i.e. 10p del vs <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> amp, P = 0.0019) but not <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> deletion and chromosomal events (i.e. 10p del vs CDKN2A del, P = 0.33). The consistently high CCF for <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> amplifications could indicate that these events precede even some larger chromosomal aberrations, while not excluding the possibility that high levels of extrachromosomal <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>
<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> artificially inflate CCF.</p>
          <p id="P18">Longitudinal changes in CCF values provide additional insights into evolutionary dynamics. For instance, the CCF value may increase when a driver event is linked to clonal expansion, or conversely, decrease when a clone is outcompeted. Most individual drivers did not demonstrate significant consistent CCF changes between the initial tumor and recurrence (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10a</xref>). A notable exception was the <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutation CCF that increased over time (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.037) in IDHmut-noncodels, but not IDHwt gliomas (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.13, <xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10b</xref>). We did not observe any differences in <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic> CCF over time among IDHmut-noncodel tumors, possibly because the general trend of these tumors to increase in CCF is counteracted by the biological loss of relevance of mutant <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic> over time (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10c</xref>). Indeed, a gross comparison of all shared mutation CCFs revealed an increase in recurrent IDHmut-noncodel tumors (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), which may reflect increased clonality and a reduction in intratumoral heterogeneity (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10d</xref>). In contrast, shared CCFs decreased in IDHwt tumors, potentially indicating a general increase in intratumoral heterogeneity at recurrence (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10d</xref>). We confirmed that IDHmutant-noncodel CCF increases and IDHwt decreases were not biased by patients with high mutation burden through the classification of patient-specific shared mutation CCF change (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10e</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P19">We next investigated whether specific somatic alterations were acquired or lost over time. Gene-specific enrichment of many recurrence-only mutations was found in hypermutated tumors, but there was no enrichment for somatic gene alterations in non-hypermutators suggesting that glioma recurrence is not directed by particular sets of mutations (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8b</xref>). Within subtypes we detected an enrichment in <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> homozygous deletions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>) in recurrent IDHmutant-noncodels, which was corroborated by additional cell cycle gene alterations (focal gain of <italic toggle="yes">CCND2, CDK4</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic>, and mutation or homozygous loss of <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic>). Mutations in cell cycle checkpoint control genes are associated with genomic instability <sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Therefore, we analyzed aneuploidy levels by determining the proportion of the genome that had undergone aneuploidy events (<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 11a</xref>-<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). We observed that IDHmutant-noncodel tumors had a higher level of aneuploidy at recurrence (Wilcoxon rank sum test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 1.4E-06 total aneuploidy, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 8.6E-03 arm-level aneuploidy, <xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 11c</xref>-<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">d</xref>) with tumors carrying acquired cell cycle gene alterations displaying the largest increases in aneuploidy (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 7.6E-06; Wilcoxon rank sum test, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). We reasoned that <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> deletions may precede aneuploidy. Homozygous <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> deletions had significantly higher CCFs compared to average CNV CCF across the genome (as a surrogate for aneuploidy related copy number changes), suggesting that <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> loss occurred prior to aneuploidy (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). These alterations may hasten disease progression as patients with either cell cycle alterations or the largest increases in aneuploidy at recurrence demonstrated significantly shorter survival than patients without these alterations (log-rank test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Taken together, the persistence of drivers over time and the paucity of consistent change imply that therapy does not result in selection of specific sets of molecular changes.</p>

          <title>Immunoediting activity in glioma</title>
          <p id="P20">We next investigated how the immune microenvironment affects evolutionary trajectories. The immune system may prune tumor cells carrying immunogenic (neo-)antigens, resulting in the selection of subclones capable of evading the immune response. Evidence of this immunoediting process has been shown in several cancer types, including glioma <sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>-<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, and suggests active immunosurveillance that may be therapeutically exploited <sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. We computationally predicted neoantigen-causing mutations<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. As expected, the neoantigen load across the GLASS cohort was strongly correlated with exonic mutation burden (Spearman’s Rho = 0.89), with 42% of nonsynonymous exonic mutations giving rise to neoantigens on average. This fraction did not significantly differ by glioma subtype or between initial and recurrent tumors (<italic toggle="yes">P &gt;</italic> 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). The most common neoantigen arose from the clonal R132H mutation in <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic> and was present in of 22 out of 88 IDH-mutant initial and recurrent tumors. Beyond mutations in <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic>, no mutations gave rise to a neoantigen found in more than three tumors at a given timepoint (<xref rid="SD7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Across the dataset, neoantigens and non-immunogenic mutations exhibited similar changes in cancer cell fractions between initial and recurrent tumors indicating a lack of neoantigen-specific selection processes over time (<xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 12a</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P21">We then examined the extent to which immunoediting occurred by comparing each sample’s observed neoantigen rate to an expected rate that was empirically derived from our dataset. The output of this approach is a normally distributed set of ratios centered at 1. Samples with an observed-to-expected neoantigen ratio &lt; 1 exhibit evidence of neoantigen depletion relative to the rest of the dataset, and thus are more likely to have been immunoedited. We found that none of the three glioma subtypes harbored observed-to-expected ratios that significantly differed from 1 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &gt; 0.05, one sample t-test), though IDHwt tumors exhibited significantly lower scores compared to IDHmut-noncodels (t-test, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.04; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). We additionally did not observe an association between the observed-to-expected ratio and survival when adjusting for subtype and age (Wald test, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &gt; 0.05), nor was there a difference between samples with neutral evolution dynamics compared to those exhibiting evidence of subclonal selection. When comparing samples longitudinally, we found that the observed-to-expected neoantigen ratio was strongly correlated between initial and recurrent tumors of each patient (Pearson’s R = 0.73, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 5E-38), suggesting that the neoantigen depletion level in the recurrence reflects that of the initial tumor (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P22">Immunoediting is most likely to take place in the tumors with high cytolytic activity and low levels of immunosuppressive activity<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. Hypermutators, which have high neoantigen loads, have previously been associated with highly cytolytic microenvironments <sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. However, we did not observe any differences in the observed-to-expected neoantigen ratio between hypermutated recurrent tumors and their initial counterparts, nor did we observe differences between hypermutated and non-hypermutated recurrent tumors, indicating that immunoediting activity is not related to the total number of mutations in a sample (Wilcoxon rank-sum test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &gt; 0.05; <xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 12b</xref>). To more directly determine whether there were immunologic factors associated with neoantigen depletion, we analyzed CIBERSORT immune cell fractions from a subset of samples that had undergone expression profiling in a previous study (n = 84 from 42 tumor pairs) <sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Initial tumors with an observed-to-expected neoantigen ratio &gt;1 exhibited significantly higher levels of CD4+ T cells than those with a ratio &lt; 1, while recurrent tumors with a ratio &gt; 1 exhibited significantly higher levels of macrophages, neutrophils, and significantly lower levels of plasma cells relative to those with ratio &lt; 1 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; <xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 12c</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P23">While we did not detect many factors associated with the observed-to-expected neoantigen ratio, we did observe that the ratio was significantly associated with the total number of unique HLA loci in a patient (Spearman’s Rho = 0.28, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 2E-9), reflecting similar findings in lung cancer<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. This may bias analyses comparing the ratio across patients. To determine whether immunoediting varies over time in a patient-agnostic manner, we compared the observed-to-expected neoantigen ratio derived from a sample’s clonal mutations, which likely arose earlier in tumor evolution, to that derived from their subclonal mutations, which likely arose later. We did not observe a significant difference in the observed-to-expected neoantigen ratio of each patient’s clonal and subclonal neoantigens, regardless of glioma subtype or whether the sample was an initial tumor or recurrence (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &gt; 0.05, paired t-test; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Together, these analyses suggest that neoantigens in glioma are not exposed to differing levels of selective pressure throughout their development.</p>

        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p id="P24">We reconstructed the evolutionary trajectories of 222 patients with glioma to better understand treatment failures and tumor progression. The longitudinal molecular profiles revealed common features such as acquired hypermutation and aneuploidy, but highlighted the individualistic paths of post-treatment glioma evolution. Our results provide evidence that current standard of care therapies do not frequently coerce glioma down predictable paths. Instead, an unexpected number of gliomas appeared to stochastically evolve following early driver events. We expect that continuing to profile patient tumors over time using comprehensive sequencing approaches will identify additional common evolutionary paths. Our results here highlight the exciting prospects of several ongoing efforts that may inform new glioma therapies.</p>
        <p id="P25">The observation that treatment-induced hypermutation occurred across subtypes, but did not confer a detrimental effect on patient survival leaves the clinical significance of glioma hypermutation uncertain<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Future analyses that consider the number of therapy cycles and <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> DNA methylation status will help to elucidate factors that predispose tumors to hypermutation and identify therapies that effectively exploit this phenotype’s vulnerabilities (e.g., high mutation burden). Acquired cell cycle alterations and aneuploidy in recurrent IDHmut-noncodel gliomas also provide a rationale to target these more aggressive phenotypes with CDK inhibitors<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> or with compounds that disrupt microtubule dynamics<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Finally, our analyses revealed that immunoediting activity does not vary in glioma over time, though we did observe variation between individual patients. Additional molecular and immunological data are needed to fully understand the impact this variability has on glioma evolution and to devise therapies directed at a glioma’s immunogenicity<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. To this end, we found that clonal neoantigens arising from the <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic> R132H mutation persisted from the initial tumor into the recurrence, justifying neoantigen vaccine approaches as treatments for initial and recurrent glioma<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P26">Collectively, these findings help shape our perspective on what constitutes an optimal treatment, and what approaches would result in the greatest removal or killing of glioma cells possible. Genomic characterization efforts such as TCGA have greatly increased our understanding of glioma biology, but were limited to a single snapshot in evolutionary time. The GLASS resource provides a framework to study the patterns of glioma evolution and treatment response.</p>

          <p id="P30">A GLASS barcode system was created, based on TCGA barcode design, in an effort to de-identify patient information and provide an organized framework for the different pieces of the dataset.</p>
          <p id="P31">GLASS barcodes are composed of 24 characters. The first four characters specify the project (either GLSS or TCGA). All datasets submitted to the GLASS consortium, published and unpublished, were given the GLSS project ID.

Thus, a surgical number was also provided to indicate temporal ordering (<xref rid="SD9" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). To include spatially separated samples the portion designation was added, which is followed by one character specifying the type of analyte, either DNA (D) or RNA (R). As there is variation in the sequencing analysis, a three-character designation represents either whole genome (WGS) or whole exome sequencing (WXS). The last part of the GLASS barcode is a six-character designation unique to each barcode that was randomly generated.</p>

          <p id="P33">Data pre-processing was conducted in accordance to the GATK Best Practices using GATK 4.0.10.1. Briefly, aligned BAM files were separated by read group, sanitized and stripped of alignments and attributes using ‘RevertSam’, giving one unaligned BAM (uBAM) file per readgroup. Uniform readgroups were assigned to uBAM files using ‘AddOrReplaceReadgroups’. Similarly, unaligned fastq files were assigned uniformly designated readgroup attributes and converted to uBAM format using ‘FastqToSam’. uBAM files underwent quality control using ‘FastQC 0.11.7’. Sequencing adapters were marked using ‘MarkIlluminaAdapters’. uBAM files were finally reverted to interleaved fastq format using ‘SamToFastq’, aligned to the b37 genome (‘human_g1k_v37_decoy’) using ‘BWA MEM 0.7.17’, attributes were restored using ‘MergeBamAlignment’. ‘MarkDuplicates’ was then used to merge aligned BAM files from multiple readgroups and to mark PCR and optical duplicates across identical sequencing libraries. Lastly, base recalibration was performed using ‘BaseRecalibrator’ followed by ‘ApplyBQSR’. Coverage statistics were gathered using ‘CollectWgsMetrics’. Alignment QC was performed running ‘ValidateSamFile’ on the final BAM file and QC results were inspected using ‘MultiQC 1.6a0’ <sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>.

Somatic variants were subsequently called in individual tumor samples (single-sample mode) and in entire patients using GATK 4.1 Mutect2 in multi-sample mode. Mutect2 was given matched control samples, the aforementioned panel of normals and the gnomAD germline resource as additional controls. Cross-sample contamination was evaluated using ‘GetPileupSummaries’ and ‘CalculateContamination’ run for both tumor and matching control samples. Read orientation artifacts were evaluated using ‘CollectF1R2Counts’ and ‘LearnReadOrientationModel’.

DNA hypermutation was defined for recurrent tumors with greater than 10 mutations per Mb sequenced as these values were considered outliers (1.5 times the interquartile range above the upper quartile). Notably, there were a few initial gliomas that demonstrated a mutational frequency above 10 mutations per Mb.

          <p id="P38">Copy number identification was performed according to the GATK Best Practices and is outlined briefly here. The pipeline differs slightly for whole genomes and whole exomes. For genomes, the genome was segmented into 10kb bins using ‘PreprocessIntervals’. For exomes, overlapping regions between several commonly used capture kits (Broad Human Exome b37, Nextera Rapid Capture, TruSeq Exome, SeqCap EZ Exome V3, Agilent SureSelect V4, Agilent SureSelect V7) were identified using ‘bedtools multiIntersectBed’. The tool ‘PreprocessIntervals’ was used to apply 1kb padding and to merge overlapping intervals. In parallel, ‘SelectVariants’ was used to subset the gnomAD resource of germline variants to variants with a population AF greater than 5%. Next, ‘CollectReadcounts’ was used to count reads in the bins generated by ‘PreprocessIntervals’ separately for autosomes and allosomes. In parallel, ‘CollectAllelicCounts’ was used to count reference and alternate reads at gnomAD variant sites with a population AF greater than 5%. The cohort was subsequently split into batches determined by sequencing center and ‘CreateReadCountPanelOfNormals’ was used to create a panel of normal (PON) for each batch. PONs were created separately for allosomes and autosomes, and allosomes were separated further by sex. To further improve the panel of normals, GC content annotation of each interval as determined by ‘AnnotateIntervals’ were given. Next, ‘DenoiseReadCounts’ was used to denoise the binned readcounts output by ‘CollectReadCounts’, given a PON determined by batch, chromosomes (allosomes or autosomes) and sex. Denoised copy ratios were plotted and inspected for quality concerns using ‘PlotDenoisedCopyRatios’. The tool ‘ModelSegments’ is an implementation of a gaussian-kernel binary-segmentation algorithm and was used to merge contiguous segments and assign copy and allelic ratios. The results of this segmentation were plotted using ‘PlotModeledSegments’ and inspected for quality concerns.</p>

          <p id="P40">Segments (from ‘ModelSegments’) with a non-log2 copy ratio between 0.9 and 1.1 were determined to be neutral.

Outlier segments are removed and once again a weighted mean and sd non-log2 copy ratio (twice-filtered) were determined. Segments with a non-log2 copy ratio between 0.9 and 1.1 and segments within two standard deviations of the twice-filtered mean were determined to be neutral, and segments outside of these boundaries were determined to have a low-level amplification or deletion, depending on the direction.</p>

The twice-filtered mean plus (high level amplification) or minus (high level deletion) two times the sd of the selected arms were used as high-level thresholds.</p>

For each merged/reduced segment, the proportion of the chromosome arm it spans was calculated. Segments spanning greater than 80% of the arm length resulted in a call of either −1 (loss), 0 (neutral) or +1 (gain) to the entire arm, or NA if no contiguous segment spanned at least 80% of the arm’s length. For each sample the number of arms with a non-neutral event was finally counted. The resulting aneuploidy score is a positive integer with a minimum value of 0 (no chromosomal arm-level events detected) and a maximum value of 39 (total number of autosomal chromosome arms excluding the short arms for chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22).</p>

          <title>Temporal changes in glioma mutational burden and processes.</title>
          <p id="P74"><bold>a</bold>. Each column represents a single patient (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 222) at two separate timepoints grouped by glioma subtype and ordered left-to-right by decreasing mutation frequency at recurrence. Top, mutation frequency differences between initial and recurrent tumors. Blue dotted line indicates increased mutation frequency while a red dotted line indicates decreased mutational frequency. Stacked bar plot reflects the proportion of total mutations shared (mustard), private to initial (magenta), or private to recurrence (blue). Clinical information including hypermutation status, therapy, and grade changes. <bold>b</bold>.
