        <abstract id="Abs1">
          <p id="Par1">Proteogenomic analyses of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) have focused on early-stage, HBV-associated HCCs. Here we present an integrated proteogenomic analysis of HCCs across clinical stages and etiologies. Pathways related to cell cycle, transcriptional and translational control, signaling transduction, and metabolism are dysregulated and differentially regulated on the genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomic levels. We describe candidate copy number-driven driver genes involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, the Wnt-β-catenin, AKT/mTOR and Notch pathways, cell cycle and DNA damage regulation. The targetable aurora kinase A and CDKs are upregulated. <italic toggle="yes">CTNNB1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations are associated with altered protein phosphorylation related to actin filament organization and lipid metabolism, respectively. Integrative proteogenomic clusters show that HCC constitutes heterogeneous subgroups with distinct regulation of biological processes, metabolic reprogramming and kinase activation. Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the proteomic and phophoproteomic landscapes of HCCs, revealing the major pathways altered in the (phospho)proteome.</p>

        <p id="Par3">Liver cancer, of which 75–85% are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), caused 782,000 deaths globally in 2018<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Genomic analyses have revealed that <italic toggle="yes">TERT</italic> promoter, <italic toggle="yes">CTNNB1</italic> (encoding β-catenin) and <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> (encoding p53) are frequently mutated in HCC, while genes involved in other critical processes, such as oxidative stress response, chromatin remodeling and hepatocyte differentiation, are recurrently mutated but in &lt;10% of HCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Transcriptomic subtyping has revealed HCC subclasses that differ in the expression of genes related to proliferation, stemness, metabolism, hepatocyte differentiation and liver function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. More recently, three mass spectrometry-based proteogenomic studies of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCCs have been published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In the first study, the proteome profiling of early-stage HBV-associated HCCs found that a subset of HCCs characterized by disrupted cholesterol homeostasis and SOAT1 overexpression was associated with poor outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Indeed, avasimibe, a SOAT1 inhibitor, effectively reduced the size of tumors overexpressing SOAT1 in patient-derived xenograft models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In the second study, integrated proteogenomic analysis of HBV-related HCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> revealed three proteome subclasses, namely metabolism, proliferation and microenvironment dysregulated subgroups, that were associated with patient survival, tumor thrombus and genetic profile. PYCR2 and ADH1A, both implicated in metabolic reprogramming in HCC, were further identified as proteomic prognostic biomarkers. In the third study, the authors found significant intratumor heterogeneity on the genome and transcriptome levels but patient specificity on the proteome and metabolome levels among resected and predominantly early-stage and HBV-associated HCCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. While these studies have provided great insights into the proteome of HCCs that are primarily early-stage and HBV-associated, relatively little of their phosphoproteome was described. In this work, we present an integrated (phospho)proteogenomic analysis of HCC biopsies across etiologies and clinical stages, representative of the wide spectrum of molecular heterogeneity of HCC. We show that HCC are underpinned by the dysregulation of oncogenic processes related to transcriptional and translational control, metabolism, the Wnt-β-catenin, AKT/mTOR and Notch pathways, which are differentially regulated on the genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomic levels.</p>

          <p id="Par4">We collected biopsies from 122 tumors from 114 patients, including seven patients with &gt;1 multicentric (genetically independent) tumors (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). 94% of the patients had at least one underlying liver disease, primarily alcohol liver disease (59%) and/or hepatitis C infection (26%). 53% of the patients were early stage (BCLC 0/A) and 47% were more advanced stage (BCLC B/C/D). None of the patients had undergone systemic therapy for their disease. We performed whole-exome sequencing and RNA-sequencing for all 122 tumors and global proteome and phosphoproteome profiling using liquid chromatography-tandem MS analyses on a subset of 51 tumors (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The proteome was measured in data-independent manner by selected window acquisition of theoretical mass (SWATH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and the phosphoproteome was measured in data-dependent and label-free manner. The subset of 51 tumors subjected to proteome and phosphoproteome profiling was representative of the entire cohort in terms of clinicopathological parameters and molecular profiles (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>).

          <p id="Par5">Principal component analyses showed that HCCs are distinct from and more variable than normal livers on the transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–c</xref>). HCCs did not segregate according to their underlying liver diseases (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).

          <p id="Par6">To identify pathways deregulated in HCC, we performed differential expression analyses of the HCC transcriptome and proteome compared to normal livers. We observed a moderate correlation between the deregulation of the transcriptome and the proteome (Spearman rho = 0.33, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). A quadrant analysis of transcriptome and proteome data showed that 37.7% (15.7% for adjusted <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> ≤ 0.05) of genes were up-regulated on both the mRNA and the protein levels, 20.9% (6.2%) were up-regulated on the mRNA level but down-regulated on the protein level, 16.6% (5.4%) were upregulated in protein but down-regulated on the mRNA level, and 24.8% (13.6%) were downregulated in both. Pathway analysis of these four quadrants revealed that the genes/proteins up-regulated on both the mRNA and the protein levels were enriched in pathways related to mRNA splicing, epigenetic regulation of rRNA expression and translation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>). By contrast, genes/proteins consistently down-regulated were enriched in metabolism pathways of amino acids, fatty acids, and other metabolites. Among genes up-regulated only on the mRNA level, pathways related to translational control, proteasome and oxidative phosphorylation were enriched. By contrast, pathways related to the complement and coagulation were enriched among proteins upregulated only on the protein level.</p>

We observed no difference in terms of the frequency of mutated genes (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>).

A pathway analysis of these phosphorylation sites suggests that <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations are associated with phosphorylation changes in proteins involved in the regulation of lipid and mRNA metabolic processes, and the regulation of cellular component biogenesis and organization (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM15" ref-type="media">12</xref>). In particular, PKR (<italic toggle="yes">EIF2AK2</italic>) S83 is an activating autophosphorylation site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. PKR is involved in diverse cellular processes, including stress response against pathogens (e.g., HCV) and its activation inhibits protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. HCV infection triggers PKR phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, though here we did not observe an enrichment of HCV-associated HCCs among the <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>-mutant HCCs (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &gt; 0.05, Fisher’s exact test). KSEA revealed that <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>-mutant HCCs showed increased CDK1/2/5 activity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>). Other kinases involved in the control of cell cycle, mitotic checkpoint and spindle formation (Aurora Kinase A, TTK, NEK2), protein synthesis and stress response (PKR), and MAPK signaling (PRKD2, p38 delta (<italic toggle="yes">MAPK13</italic>)) also showed increased activity when comparing overall phosphorylation levels.</p>
          <p id="Par22">Taken together, the proteogenomic analysis suggests that the loss of epithelial phenotype seen in <italic toggle="yes">CTNNB1</italic>-mutant HCCs may result from alterations in phosphorylation of proteins involved in the organization of actin filaments, thereby regulating cell polarity and migration, whereas <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>-mutant HCCs are associated with altered phosphorylation of proteins related to lipid metabolism and cell cycle control.</p>

          <title>Molecular subtypes of HCC</title>
          <p id="Par23">We performed unsupervised analyses to identify HCC subtypes in each of the 5 individual omics data sets, namely, somatic mutation, CNA, transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome (‘single-omics’) as well as an integrative analysis incorporating all 5 (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 51 with complete data, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>). For the single-omics analyses, we identified 2–4 robust clusters using two independent approaches. The four somatic mutation subclasses were characterized by mutations in <italic toggle="yes">CTNNB1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic> or the lack of <italic toggle="yes">CTNNB1</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic> mutations, the two CNA subclasses were distinguished by the level of genomic instability, while the three transcriptome subclasses were distinguished by elevated cell cycle related processes, immune pathways or metabolism (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM16" ref-type="media">13</xref>). Of note, mutation cluster 3 and transcriptome cluster 1 were associated with high Edmondson grade. Similarly, the mutation and transcriptome clusters but not the CNA subclasses were associated with the Hoshida molecular subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par24">For the proteome and phosphoproteome, in each case two clusters were identified. Proteome subclass 1 is associated with ribonucleoprotein organization, and mRNA splicing and processing, while subclass 2 is associated with metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM16" ref-type="media">13</xref>). Phosphoproteome subclass 1 is also linked to ribonucleoprotein assembly and mRNA splicing and processing but also to chromatin organization and CK II alpha activation. Instead, phosphoproteome subclass 2 is associated with telomere maintenance, nucleosome organization, DNA repair, actin cytoskeleton regulation and PKA C-alpha activation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM16" ref-type="media">13</xref>). The proteome clusters, but not the phosphoproteome clusters, are associated with Edmondson grade and the Hoshida molecular subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>). In particular, proteome cluster 1 was enriched for high-grade and high-stage HCCs. Further, significant association was observed between mutation, transcriptome and proteome clusterings, but not with the phosphoproteome clusters (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>).<fig id="Fig5" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Integrated phosphoproteomic classification of HCC.</title><p>Unsupervised clustering of the (<bold>a</bold>) proteome and (<bold>b</bold>) phosphoproteome data using consensus non-negative matrix factorization. <bold>c</bold> Integrative clustering of the mutation, copy number alteration, transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome using the iCluster method.

          <p id="Par25">We then asked whether an integrative clustering using all five omics would provide further insight into the diversity of HCC. Using the iCluster method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, we defined three robust clusters (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>), which are largely recapitulated using the algorithmically distinct similarity network fusion (SNF) approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>). To investigate how the three clusters differ from each other, we compared them on the individual molecular levels (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">14</xref>). In cluster 1, we observed an enrichment of genes involved in ECM organization, angiogenesis and amino acid metabolism on the mRNA level and amino acid metabolism on the protein level. In cluster 2, pathways related to fatty acid, amino acid and small molecule metabolism were enriched on both the mRNA and protein levels. In cluster 3, pathways related to cell proliferation, chromatin assembly and RNA processing were enriched on both the mRNA and protein levels, while on the phosphoprotein level, we observed pathways related to cell cycle, epigenetic gene regulation and activation of CDK1/2/6. No specific CNAs were enriched in any subclass. Integrative clusters 2 and 3 were associated with low- and high-grade HCCs, respectively. Compared to the single-omics clustering, the integrative clusters were associated with the mutation, transcriptome and proteome clusters but not with the CNA or the phosphoproteome clusters (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Furthermore, we also found that the integrative clusters, as well as the single-omics clustering of mutation, transcriptome and proteome to be associated with the previously published molecular subtypes defined by Hoshida et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par26">Finally, to assess whether the single-omics and integrative molecular subclasses are prognostic, we performed univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses. In the univariate analyses, transcriptome cluster 1 (increased cell proliferation, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.037), proteome cluster 1 (ribonucleoprotein organization and mRNA processing, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.022) and integrative cluster 3 (increased cell proliferation, epigenetic gene regulation, and <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutation, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.005) were associated with poor overall survival, while proteome cluster 2 (metabolism, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.022) and integrative cluster 2 (metabolism and <italic toggle="yes">CTNNB1</italic> mutation, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.015) were associated with improved overall survival (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In the multivariate analyses incorporating primary prognostic indicator BCLC, mutation cluster 2 (<italic toggle="yes">CTNNB1</italic>-mutant) was associated with good prognosis (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.025) and mutation cluster 3 (<italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>-mutant) was associated with poor prognosis (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.034) independent of BCLC (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par27">In summary, while molecular clustering of the proteome data largely recapitulated that of the transcriptome and histological grading, molecular clustering of the phosphoproteome data differed from that of other single-omics and integrative clustering.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p id="Par28">Our integrated proteogenomic analysis of HCC biopsies across etiologies and clinical stages revealed similar but also distinct biological processes, metabolic reprogramming and signaling pathway activation on the different molecular levels. We found that RNA processing was consistently upregulated and metabolic pathways were downregulated on the transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome levels. Interestingly, translational regulation-related genes were upregulated on the mRNA but not the protein level. One could speculate that the increased transcription of translational regulation-related genes may be a compensatory mechanism for increased protein degradation. On the phosphoproteome level, altered protein phosphorylation was associated with pathways related to cell cycle, immune system, and DNA repair, as well as oncogenic signaling pathways such as MAPK, PI3K/Akt/PTEN and FGFR. Indeed, KSEA revealed the increased activity of ERK1/2 and cell cycle-related kinases such as AURKA, CDK1/2/5/7, PLK1 and TTK.</p>
        <p id="Par29">We also identified putative HCC driver genes and drug targets. We showed that <italic toggle="yes">GPAM</italic> is a frequently mutated gene in HCC. Among genes and proteins that show positive correlation on the CNA-mRNA and mRNA-protein levels and are dysregulated in HCC, we identified candidate driver genes, such as <italic toggle="yes">NUDCD1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">UBQLN4</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">BYSL</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ATP6V1C1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">RRM2B</italic> involved in diverse processes including EMT, cell cycle and DNA damage regulation, and the regulation of the Wnt-β-catenin, AKT/mTOR and Notch pathways. At least two of them have been suggested as therapeutic targets. Specifically, <italic toggle="yes">UBQLN4</italic> is reported to repress homologous recombination repair and promotes sensitivity to PARP1 inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, while <italic toggle="yes">RRB2M</italic>, a gene that appears to promote tumorigenesis in hypoxic conditions and encodes a component of the ribonucleotide reductase, may be targeted by gemcitabine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, a chemotherapeutic agent sometimes used to treat HCC. Our phosphoproteome analysis also revealed targetable kinases with elevated activity, especially Aurora Kinase A and CDKs. Aurora Kinase A and CDK1/2 are classical cell cycle-related kinases whereas CDK5 regulates many biological processes, including angiogenesis and DNA damage response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Preclinical studies have shown that Aurora Kinase A and CDK1/2/5 inhibitors are efficacious in HCC models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> and may act synergistically with sorafenib/regorafenib and chemotherapeutic agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. Integrative clustering of HCCs reveal that cluster 2 was enriched for <italic toggle="yes">CTNNB1</italic> mutants, suggesting Wnt signaling may be a potential therapeutic target for tumors in this cluster. On the other hand, integrative cluster 3 is characterized by elevated cell cycle signatures and CDK1/2/6 activity. CDKs, in particular CDK4/6, are well-established therapeutic targets. These results also suggest potential molecularly driven putative drug targets in specific HCC subsets.</p>
        <p id="Par30"><italic toggle="yes">CTNNB1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> are the two most frequently mutated genes in HCC. We identified altered phosphorylation sites in proteins, such as ACF7, MAP1B, PDLIM2 and Par3-alpha, that may underpin the loss of epithelial phenotype frequently seen in <italic toggle="yes">CTNNB1</italic>-mutant HCCs. ACF7 (<italic toggle="yes">MACF1</italic>), part of the β-catenin destruction complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>, is required for stabilizing Axin upon Wnt activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. Wnt activation causes GSK3 inactivation and inability to phosphorylate ACF7, and dephosphorylated ACF7 remains active and able to form necessary connections between microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton to enable migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Similarly, GSK3 inactivation decreases MAP1B phosphorylation and facilitates microtubule assembly and migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. By contrast, PDLIM2 is required for polarized cell migration and its phosphorylation facilitates β-catenin activation and nuclear translocation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Par3-alpha (<italic toggle="yes">PARD3</italic>), a regulator of tight junction assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, changes the affinity for its interaction partners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> upon phosphorylation, leading to loss of cell polarity and induction of migration. KSEA of <italic toggle="yes">CTNNB1</italic>-mutant HCCs also revealed increased activity of FGR, involved in immune response and cytoskeleton remodeling. In contrast to a previous study of HBV-associated HCCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, we did not observe elevated ALDOA S36 phosphorylation in our cohort of <italic toggle="yes">CTNNB1</italic>-mutant HCCs (FDR = 0.98). Instead, KSEA of <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>-mutant HCCs identified increased activity of CDK1/2/5, which could in part explain the higher histological grade typically associated with <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations. Our analysis also identified altered phosphorylation of proteins involved in lipid metabolism in <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>-mutant HCCs. p53 with a gain-of-function mutation has been reported to promote lipid synthesis via at least two mechanisms, by activating the SREBP transcription factors and by inhibiting AMPK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. Finally, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, the presence of <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations is associated with loss of expression on the mRNA level.</p>
        <p id="Par31">Proteome and phosphoproteome classifications revealed two clusters each. Although for both classifications, one of the clusters was associated with overexpression or enhanced phosphorylation of proteins involved in ribonucleoprotein organization, and mRNA processing and splicing, there was little concordance between the two classifications. The lack of concordance of the phosphoproteome clusters was also seen with mutation, transcriptome and integrative clusters. As protein phosphorylation is highly dynamic and our profiling captures a snapshot of the tumor, phosphoproteomic data are inherently noisier than other types of molecular data. Integrative clustering, using the algorithmically distinct iCluster and SNF, identified three clusters that resembled the spectrum of Edmondson grade and BCLC. They also resemble the three proteome subclasses identified in two previous studies in HBV-related HCC, both of which described subclasses characterized by metabolic reprogramming, microenvironment dysregulation and cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In particular, the proliferation proteome subclasses in HBV-related HCC were associated with tumor thrombus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and microscopic vascular invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Here our integrative cluster 3 (increased cell proliferation and <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutation) is associated with macro-vascular invasion (p = 0.01, Fisher’s exact test) and poor outcomes. However, it should be noted that our cohort was accrued over a long period and clinical practice has changed significantly over the past decade, hence outcome data are inherently difficult to interpret.</p>
        <p id="Par32">Proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling technologies have improved significantly over the past decade but are not without challenges. In our study, we performed (phospho)proteomic profiling for about half of the samples but in triplicates to ensure robust statistics. Compared to WES and RNA-seq, (phospho)proteome data are relatively sparse and not all proteins and phosphorylation sites can be detected. It should also be noted that not all proteins are expressed at a given time at detectable levels and the detection of phosphorylation sites is challenging due to the high degree of variability between tissues and samples. Further, some phosphorylation sites may never be detected as they are on hard-to-detect peptides. Our study has also generated interesting leads for future studies. Mutagenesis experiments would be required to properly dissect the effect of <italic toggle="yes">CTNNB1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations on the phosphoproteome. The fact that seven of the nine <italic toggle="yes">GPAM</italic> mutations were frameshift mutations together with the observation that knockdown of <italic toggle="yes">GPAM</italic> significantly increased cell proliferation strongly suggests a tumor suppressor role for <italic toggle="yes">GPAM</italic> in HCC. A full characterization of the functional role of the individual frameshift mutations in <italic toggle="yes">GPAM</italic> would require further experiments.</p>
        <p id="Par33">Our study generated proteome and phosphoproteome data (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>) for a wide spectrum of HCCs across all clinical stages and major etiologies, thus more representative of the molecular heterogeneity of HCC than previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In particular, our analysis of the phosphoproteome has provided deeper insights into the major processes and kinases altered in HCC compared to previous studies. Our analyses of the CNA-mRNA-protein correlation, phosphoproteome and integrative clusters of HCCs have also nominated a number of putative drivers and drug targets that may warrant further study in the future. In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the proteomic and phosphoproteomic landscape of HCCs, identifying proteome and phosphoproteome alterations underlying HCC.</p>

The biopsies from the 11 patients with healthy livers were measured individually and also as a pool. This pool was measured as a reference several times over the course of the project to account for potential batch effects. Ten biopsy samples were measured together as one batch of samples on the same capillary column. For library generation, 100 μg of peptides from each of the 10 biopsies of one batch were pooled together and subjected to high-pH fractionation with a total of 1 mg of peptide injected by 5 individual injections of 200 μg. Peptides were fractionated by high-pH reversed phase separation using a XBridge Peptide BEH C18 column (3.5 μm, 130 Å, 1 mm × 150 mm, Waters) on an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC system. Peptides were loaded on column in buffer A (ammonium formate (20 mM, pH 10) in H2O) and eluted using a two-step linear 60 min gradient from 2% to 50% (v/v) buffer B (90% acetonitrile/10% ammonium formate (20 mM, pH 10) at a flow rate of 42 μl/min.

The solvents used for peptide separation were 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid and 80% AcCN in water (solvent B). Two microliters of sample were injected. A linear gradient from 0–40% solvent B in solvent A in 190 min was delivered with the nano pump at a flow rate of 200 nL/min. After 190 min, solvent B was increased to 95% in 5 min. The eluting peptides were ionized at 2.5 kV. Singly charged ions and ions with unassigned charge state were excluded from triggering MS2 events. For SWATH measurements, one Full MS-SIM scan at resolution of 70,000 was followed by 40 mass windows of dynamic size ranging from 400 to 1600 m/z with 4 kDa overlap at a resolution of 17,500. For library measurements, the mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode and the precursor scan was done in the Orbitrap at 70,000 resolution. A top-20 method was run.

Specifically, phosphorylated peptides were enriched using Fe(III)-NTA 5 μL cartridges (Agilent technologies) in an automated fashion using the AssayMAP Bravo Platform (Agilent Technologies). Fe(III)-NTA cartridges were primed with 250 μL of 0.1% TFA in ACN and equilibrated with 250 μL of loading buffer (80% ACN/0.1% TFA). Samples were dissolved in 160 μL of loading buffer and loaded onto the cartridge. The columns were washed with 250 μL of loading buffer, and the phosphorylated peptides were eluted with 25 μL of 1% ammonia directly into 25 μL of 10% formic acid. Samples were dried in the speedvac at low temperature and stored at −20 °C. We used an input peptide amount of approx. 165 μg for the phosphoenrichment. For 3 biopsies, input to phosphoenrichment was slightly reduced but was accounted for by Progenesis/SafeQuant (see below). These 3 samples did not show an outlier pattern in terms of the quantified phosphorylation sites after data processing and were included in subsequent analyses. The μRPLC–MS system was set up as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup>. Chromatographic separation of peptides was carried out using an EASY nano-LC 1000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), equipped with a heated RP-HPLC column (75 μm × 37 cm) packed in-house with 1.9 μm C18 resin (Reprosil-AQ Pur, Dr. Maisch). Dried phosphopeptides were resuspended in 20 μl of 0.1% formic acid and 3 μl of the sample were injected per triplicate LC–MS/MS run. Samples were analyzed using a linear gradient ranging from 95% solvent A (0.15% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile) and 5% solvent B (98% acetonitrile, 2% water, 0.15% formic acid) to 30% solvent B over 90 min at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (both Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each MS1 scan was followed by high-collision-dissociation (HCD) of the 10 most abundant precursor ions with dynamic exclusion for 20 s. Total cycle time was approximately 1 s. For MS1, 3e6 ions were accumulated in the Orbitrap cell over a maximum time of 100 ms and scanned at a resolution of 120,000 FWHM (at 200 m/z). MS2 scans were acquired at a target setting of 1e5 ions, accumulation time of 50 ms and a resolution of 30,000 FWHM (at 200 m/z). Singly charged ions and ions with unassigned charge state were excluded from triggering MS2 events. The normalized collision energy was set to 27%, the mass isolation window was set to 1.4 m/z and one microscan was acquired for each spectrum. The samples were measured in triplicates. The acquired raw-files were imported into the Progenesis QI software (v2.0, Nonlinear Dynamics Limited), which was used to extract peptide precursor ion intensities across all samples applying the default parameters. The generated mgf-files were searched using MASCOT (version 2.4.1) against a decoy database containing normal and reverse sequences of the predicted SwissProt entries of Homo sapiens (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk">www.ebi.ac.uk</ext-link>) and commonly observed contaminants generated using the SequenceReverser tool from the MaxQuant software (version 1.0.13.13). The search criteria were set as follows: full tryptic specificity was required; 3 missed cleavages were allowed; carbamidomethylation (C) was set as fixed modification; oxidation (M) and phosphorylation (STY) were applied as variable modifications; mass tolerance of 10 ppm (precursor) and 0.02 Da (fragments). The database search results were filtered using the ion score to set the false discovery rate (FDR) to 1% on the peptide and protein level, respectively, based on the number of reverse protein sequence hits in the datasets. The relative quantitative data obtained were normalized and statistically analyzed using SafeQuant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup>. Here the gMin algorithm was chosen.

In order to generate quantitative data for single phosphorylation sites, peptides with more than one phosphorylation site were deconvoluted.

The raw intensities of the triplicates were averaged and the mean values transformed by the logarithm to the base 2. Next, the values were normalized by median subtraction. The phospho-enrichments were performed and measured in three batches due to the limitation of the number of MS runs that can be performed using the same capillary column. In each batch also an aliquot of the pooled healthy sample was enriched and measured. Normalization to the pooled healthy sample was then performed batch-wise to the pooled healthy sample enriched and measured at the same time with the same batch. Localization probabilities of each phosphorylation site were determined per batch using ScaffoldPTM (Version 3.2.0) (Proteome Software) and the maximum observed localization probability observed was assigned to each phosphorylation site.
