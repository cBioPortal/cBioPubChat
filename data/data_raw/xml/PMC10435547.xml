          <p id="Par1">Up to 50% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) develop brain metastasis (BM), yet the study of BM genomics has been limited by tissue access, incomplete clinical data, and a lack of comparison with paired extracranial specimens. Here we report a cohort of 233 patients with resected and sequenced (MSK-IMPACT) NSCLC BM and comprehensive clinical data. With matched samples (47 primary tumor, 42 extracranial metastatic), we show <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A/B</italic> deletions and cell cycle pathway alterations to be enriched in the BM samples. Meaningful clinico-genomic correlations are noted, namely <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> alterations in leptomeningeal disease (LMD) and <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> amplifications in multifocal regional brain progression. Patients who developed early LMD frequently have had uncommon, multiple, and persistently detectable <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> driver mutations. The distinct mutational patterns identified in BM specimens compared to other tissue sites suggest specific biologic underpinnings of intracranial progression.</p>

        <p id="Par3">Lung cancer is a devastating disease that remains a leading cause of cancer-associated death and morbidity worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The standard treatment approach for limited BM is resection or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), although some targeted agents showed promising activity in the central nervous system (CNS). Patients with BMs, however, are often excluded from clinical trials of novel targeted agents given the unpredictable relationship between systemic and CNS responses.</p>
        <p id="Par4">The paucity of high-quality BM samples has limited efforts to understand the fundamental biology of BM, tropism, and biomarkers of CNS progression. Prior studies have sought to understand the molecular characteristics of BM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of a heterogeneous cohort of 86 BMs, including tumors from breast, lung, and other primary histologic types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> demonstrated branched evolution from the primary tumor to matched BMs while finding genetic homogeneity among spatially and temporally separated BMs. A more focused analysis of BM specimens from 73 NSCLC patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> revealed more frequent copy number alterations in <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A/B, MYC, YAP1</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">MMP13</italic> in BM specimens, as compared to a matched TCGA cohort. A recent larger-scale study evaluated 3035 NSCLC patients (67 of whom had paired BM and primary tumor samples) using a hybrid capture-based comprehensive genomic profiling assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. They reported alterations in various genes (such as <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> etc.) enriched in the BM cohort compared to unmatched primary sites. Unfortunately, sparse clinical outcomes were reported.</p>
        <p id="Par5">In the current analysis, we expanded on this prior work through molecular profiling and detailed clinical annotation on a large, homogenous cohort of NSCLC BM specimens with both matched primary tumor (PT) and extracranial metastasis (EM) samples. The main objectives were to (1) describe the unique molecular features of NSCLC BM and (2) identify genomic biomarkers associated with intracranial disease progression.</p>

          <p id="Par8">When comparing mutations, copy-number alterations (CNAs, i.e., amplifications and deletions), and structural variants (i.e., rearrangement and fusions) between the BM, EM, and PT specimens, <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A/B</italic> alterations were more common in the BM samples (34%) compared to PT (13% <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.003, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.04; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>; Supplementary Data File <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>). A similar representation of alterations was identified in other cancer-related genes (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>) in the BM specimens as in the EM and PT. <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> alterations were not enriched in the BM specimens compared to the other two groups.</p>
          <p id="Par9">At the pathway-level, cell cycle pathway alterations were more common in the BM specimens compared to the PT specimens (56% vs. 32%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.004, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.041; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). This effect was driven by differences in <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A/B</italic> alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. When genome-wide CNAs were examined among the three groups, a higher amount of chromosomal instability was observed in the BM samples compared to the other groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>).</p>

          <title>Stratified analyses by histologic subtype</title>
          <p id="Par10">When we compared gene and pathway alterations seen in the BM specimens, stratified by histology (LUAD, squamous cell carcinoma [SCC], and other NSCLC) we noted more frequent <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">STK11</italic> alterations (<italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic>: 35% vs 9%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0. 009, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.049; <italic toggle="yes">STK11</italic>: 22% vs 0%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.01, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.049), as well as RTK-Ras pathway alterations in LUAD BM samples as compared to the SCC BM samples (86% vs 57%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.002, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.022) (Suppl. Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> deletions were more frequent in SCC group as compared to LUAD group. Examination of genome-wide CNAs across histologies revealed markedly varying CNA profiles (Suppl. Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1B, C</xref>), consistent with previously reported results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p id="Par11">Thus, to mitigate potential confounding from primary tumor histology, further analyses were performed exclusively in the LUAD cohort (180 of 233, 77%). One other sample was excluded from further genomic analyses due to a high degree of microsatellite instability (MSI). Therefore, 179 BM, 37 PT, and 34 EM samples were included in subsequent analyses. The overall makeup of this sub-cohort was like that of the entire cohort (Suppl. Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Similarly, FGA was significantly higher in LUAD BM compared to EM or PT (Supp. Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1C</xref>). Analogous to the total NSCLC cohort, <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A/B</italic> alterations and cell cycle pathway alterations remained enriched in the BM LUAD group compared to PT and EM (<italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A/B</italic>: 31% vs 18%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.004, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.14; cell cycle pathway: 52% vs 27%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.007, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.072) (Suppl.

          <p id="Par12">To assess associations between PT genomic profiles and development of BM or EM, three distinct cohorts of LUAD PT samples were compared as outlined above: (1) PT LUAD BM+ (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 32), (2) PT LUAD BM−, EM+ (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 1549), and (3) PT LUAD BM−, EM− (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 582)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.

          <p id="Par13">We next performed detailed pairwise comparisons of matched specimens, collected asynchronously or synchronously as described above. Interestingly, patients who had BM resection followed by EM or PT biopsy, and patients who had an initial tissue collected from EM/PT, and subsequently developed BM demonstrated many alterations unique to the BM specimens (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A, B</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> (34%) <italic toggle="yes">and EGFR</italic> (27%), alterations were commonly identified alterations shared between BM and later PT/EM samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>; Suppl. Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2A</xref>). In contrast, alterations in <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> were often present at diagnosis and retained in the PT/EM and BM specimens of patients who developed BM later in their clinical course (Suppl.

          <p id="Par14">When we compared matched pairs of BM and subsequently acquired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens, we noted that some BM specimens had unique alterations in <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic>, but there were notably very few unique mutations in the CSF specimens (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>; Suppl. Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>C). Among patients with simultaneous collection of BM and PT, most alterations were unique to BM or PT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>); however, this finding is limited by sample size (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 2). We were able to identify a subset of nine patients in whom we had multiple BM specimens. Seven of these patients had two independent lesions resected. Interestingly and in contrast to the synchronous BM/PT specimens, we found high concordance in the genomic profiles in these BM-BM pairs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par15">Finally, we identified two patients with three specimens collected through their illness. Remarkably, in one patient who had a PT followed by a BM and then a separate PT sequenced, we identified numerous driver mutations, none of which were shared; by contrast, in another patient who had an EM, then BM, and then a PT biopsied, we noted shared driver mutations in <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). In this patient, there was evidence of acquired resistance in the BM specimen, identifying an <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> T790M mutation in the BM specimen that was retained in the subsequent PT specimen.</p>

          <title>Genomic biomarkers of intracranial disease progression</title>
          <p id="Par17">Most (101, 56%) LUAD patients with BM experienced intracranial POD following initial craniotomy and RT, most frequently as regional progression (54, 30%), followed by local progression (25, 14%), and LMD (20, 11%). Two patients had unclear intracranial disease progression patterns and were excluded from the cohort. The median OS and iPFS from BM diagnosis was 2.7 years (95%CI 2.3–4.0) and 1.2 years (95%CI 1.0–1.5), respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B, C</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par18">To evaluate genomic biomarkers of intracranial disease progression, we grouped patients by pattern of progression and looked for differences in driver mutation frequency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). We found that patients in the LMD cohort were more likely to have <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> alterations as compared to the non-progressor group (45% vs 21%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.044, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.789). By contrast, patients with local progression had more frequent <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> loss (24% vs. 6%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.022, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.573) or <italic toggle="yes">NKX3-1</italic> alterations (16% vs. 3%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.044, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.573) as compared to the non-progressor group. Likewise, <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> amplifications were more common in patients who later suffered multifocal regional progression, compared to those with local progression, where no <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> amplifications were detected (22% vs 0%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.023, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.790). There was no statistically significant difference in <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A/B</italic> alterations across the five cohorts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">NKX2-1</italic> had a higher amplification frequency (22%) in patients without intracranial disease progression than those with local progression or LMD (4% and 10 %, respectively). We also noted more frequent alterations in <italic toggle="yes">NF1</italic> in patients who developed LMD (15%) as compared to other groups (Suppl. Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2F</xref>).</p>
          <p id="Par19">Upon assessing frequencies of oncogenic pathway alterations, MYC pathway alterations were significantly enriched in the patients with LMD (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.013, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.14) and regional progression (both single: <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.023, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.255, and multifocal: <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.023, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.255) compared to local progression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). Most cases appear to require cell cycle pathway alterations for initial BM progression (Suppl. Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2D</xref>). However, these alterations do not influence patterns of POD (Suppl. Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2E</xref>). Alteration frequencies within the RTK and RAS pathways were assessed across progression patterns to identify concurrent events. <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> were the most frequently altered genes (Suppl. Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2F</xref>). Assessment of WGD events across the progression groups revealed that patients with LMD had the numerically highest WGD frequency (Suppl.

          <p id="Par21">We next identified patients with LMD as an initial form of disease progression who had multiple tissue samples collected throughout their disease course for more in-depth evaluation. We identified that above-described uncommon <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> mutations were persistent in various tissue samples despite various therapies. For example, the first patient presented with BM at the time of initial lung cancer diagnosis and underwent craniotomy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). This BM specimen contained <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> L861Q and G719S driver mutations. After BM resection and postoperative RT, the patient received erlotinib, but developed systemic progression, with repeat lung biopsy revealing a known gatekeeper mutation (<italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> T790M); <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> L861Q and G719S remained persistent. Systemic therapy was switched to osimertinib, and eventually, the patient had further systemic progression with contemporaneous LMD; additional biopsy specimens demonstrated clearance of the T790M mutation but ongoing presence of the L861Q and G719S mutations.</p>
          <p id="Par22">In another example (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>), a patient presented with BM at initial lung cancer diagnosis and underwent BM resection. The BM specimen contained an <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> exon-19 deletion <italic toggle="yes">(</italic>E746_A750del). The patient received postoperative RT followed by osimertinib and chemotherapy but still developed early LMD. CSF sampling showed elevated circulating tumor cells (CTCs) that were cleared after proton craniospinal irradiation, but multiple serial CSF samples showed persistence of the <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> exon-19 deletion and a <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> R273L mutation until the patient succumbed to neurologic disease.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p id="Par23">In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the genomic features and clinical correlates of a large cohort of NSCLC BM patients with matched extracranial and serially collected samples. We demonstrate that NSCLC BM are markedly altered compared to extracranial metastatic or primary disease, with higher TMB, FGA, and WGD seen in BM specimens. We confirm prior reports indicating cell cycle alterations, such as deep deletions in <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A/B</italic>, are a common molecular feature of BM. Through the comparison of matched pairs of BM-EM/PT specimens, we noted generally high genomic concordance although uncommon private alterations of potential significance were noted in BM specimens. In an integrated analysis, we correlated brain-specific clinical outcomes with genomic alterations; provocatively, we found that patients who suffered leptomeningeal disease were more likely to have BM specimens with non-canonical <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> mutations, which were persistent despite maximal EGFR-directed and local therapy.</p>
        <p id="Par24">This work is part of ongoing efforts to understand the biological underpinnings of BM across various cancer types. Common events that appear important for CNS progression include chromosomal instability, impaired DNA repair, copy number alterations, and cell cycle alterations. Specifically, copy number deletion of <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A</italic> has been one of the most frequently reported events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. CDKN2A can inactivate the RB protein by binding to and inactivating the cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase four (cdk4) complex. The expression of this gene can cause cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, inhibit cell proliferation, promote tumor cell apoptosis, and increase tumor cell chemotherapy sensitivity. The current study confirms frequent loss of <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A/B</italic> and concordant cell cycle pathway alterations in NSCLC BM. Furthermore, ~50% of patients from this cohort had CNA in cell cycle genes that were non-overlapping and mutually exclusive, suggesting that this is an essential event in the development of brain metastasis. In this study, BM specimens showed global changes, including increased CNA, FGA, and TMB compared to extracranial specimens, which is in agreement with prior reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> suggesting divergent and branched evolution of BMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. By contrast, we noted concordance of alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors such as <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>, suggesting that these are essential, and independent of tumor microenvironment (TME). BM-specific cell cycle alterations may offer opportunities for targeted therapies such as CDK4/6 inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, which is the focus of ongoing trial work.</p>
        <p id="Par25">We performed a detailed analysis of patient-matched BM-PT/EM pairs. Most mutations were present in both BM and matched PT/EM samples. Although underpowered to explore fully, we noted instances of BM private mutations with potential functional relevance; for example, several patients who developed BM as a form of treatment failure had acquired driver alterations in <italic toggle="yes">HLA-B</italic>. Homozygous deletions in <italic toggle="yes">HLA-B</italic> have previously been reported to confer acquired resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in LUAD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and other work has suggested <italic toggle="yes">HLA-B</italic> downregulation as a means by which metastatic clones escape T-lymphocyte and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In the context of recent single-cell sequencing data showing that the brain TME is characterized by reduced antigen presentation and B/T-cell function and increased M2-type macrophage activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, <italic toggle="yes">HLA-B</italic> alterations in LUAD cells may be permissive for cancer cell growth in the brain TME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par26">This study offers unique integration of CNS-specific clinical outcomes with genomic alterations in a large cohort of patients. We identified specific alterations that correlated with patterns of failure: we found <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> amplification to be associated with multifocal regional failure, whereas <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> deletions and <italic toggle="yes">NKX3-1</italic> alterations were associated with local disease progression. Mouse models of brain metastasis have indicated that overexpression of <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> promotes tumor cell dissemination in brain tissues through protection against oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The association of <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> with local failure is puzzling since one might expect <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> loss to sensitize residual microscopic disease to adjuvant radiation therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>; however, co-occurrence of <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> loss with other mutations might promote RT resistance. <italic toggle="yes">NKX3-1</italic> is less understood within the context of NSCLC but is associated with metastatic disease in prostate cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. With further validation, such findings could represent potential predictive biomarkers and inform therapeutic selection.</p>
        <p id="Par27">Finally, patients who suffered LMD as a first form of intracranial failure were far more likely to have <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> alterations in BM specimens. Many of these alterations were uncommon drivers and continued to be detectable in serial samples despite maximal therapy with <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>-directed TKIs and RT. Prior work has demonstrated that patients with atypical <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> alterations receive lesser benefit from Osimertinib, with shorter overall survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. More generally, it is known that EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients are predisposed to LMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The metabolic and microenvironmental features of CSF are markedly different from brain parenchyma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>; thus, activating <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> mutations may offer a means of spreading to and surviving in this otherwise nutrient-poor environment. Thus, the result that patients with non-canonical <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> mutations in their resected BM specimens were more likely to fail with LMD rather than other forms of intracranial failure may be reflective of the combined effects of partial therapeutic resistance to Osimertinib and inherent tropism for the leptomeninges, in the context of a cohort of patients with otherwise excellent brain control and longer overall survival than non-oncogene driven NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par28">This study is limited by its retrospective design of a highly selected group of NSCLC patients with limited BM that were large and symptomatic, who therefore required surgical resection; thus, the genomic profiles and clinical outcomes for such patients may differ significantly from those with more extensive disease at diagnosis. Molecular data were obtained from routine clinical NGS (MSK-IMPACT), and thus only known cancer-associated genes were interrogated. Future work will include whole-exome DNA and whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing to identify potentially relevant non-coding elements, lesser-known somatic alterations, and transcriptional programs that are critical for the development and progression of brain metastasis.</p>

          <title>Brain-specific clinical outcomes</title>
          <p id="Par31">Brain-specific clinical outcomes were defined based on standard approaches to clinical practice. Five distinct intracranial disease progression outcomes included: (1) no evidence of intracranial progression (POD) for at least 6 months of clinical follow-up, (2) local progression (i.e., clear evidence of regrowth of the initially resected lesion with orthogonal imaging in the form of PET brain or perfusion to confirm active disease, as opposed to radionecrosis/treatment effect), (3) regional progression with a single new lesion (i.e., a new solitary lesion outside of the resected intracranial cavity), (4) multifocal regional progression (i.e., more than one lesion outside of the resected intracranial cavity) and (5) leptomeningeal disease (LMD) development (clear evidence confirmed by contrast-enhanced MRI brain with corroborating neurologic symptoms and/or positive CSF cytology). In cases of mixed POD patterns, patients with regional and local progression were considered regional POD, and patients with LMD with simultaneous concern for local or regional POD were considered to have LMD. Radiographic POD was called per the above clinical criteria by a board-certified neuroradiologist, often reviewed at a multidisciplinary tumor board, with the use of orthogonal imaging (contrast-enhanced MRI brain combined with perfusion, PET, delayed contrast, or spectroscopy) and pathologic data, and verified by documentation of a change in clinical management in subsequent medical or radiation oncology notes.</p>
          <p id="Par32">To assess whether underlying genomic profiles of PT in patients with LUAD are associated with BM development, LUAD PT samples from the paired analysis were compared to two distinct institutional LUAD PT cohorts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In this manner, three distinct cohorts of LUAD PT samples were formed: (1) patients who developed metastatic disease with intracranial involvement (PT LUAD BM+), (2) patients who developed only extracranial metastatic disease (PT LUAD BM−, EM+), and (3) patients who never developed metastatic disease of any sort (PT LUAD BM−, EM−).</p>

This is a custom FDA-authorized next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based assay that uses a paired-sample analysis pipeline to identify somatic variants in the targeted exons with an average coverage depth of 700x. Tumor DNA was sequenced using one of four versions of MSK-IMPACT (IMPACT 341, IMPACT 410, IMPACT 468, or IMPACT 505). A matched normal sample (blood) was used in all cases.
