          <p id="P12">High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC) originates from fallopian tube (FT) precursors. However, the molecular changes that occur as precancerous lesions progress to HGSOC are not well understood. To address this, we integrated high-plex imaging and spatial transcriptomics to analyze human tissue samples at different stages of HGSOC development, including p53 signatures, serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STIC), and invasive HGSOC. Our findings reveal immune modulating mechanisms within precursor epithelium, characterized by chromosomal instability, persistent interferon (IFN) signaling, and dysregulated innate and adaptive immunity. FT precursors display elevated expression of MHC-class I, including HLA-E, and IFN-stimulated genes, typically linked to later-stage tumorigenesis. These molecular alterations coincide with progressive shifts in the tumor microenvironment, transitioning from immune surveillance in early STICs to immune suppression in advanced STICs and cancer. These insights identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HGSOC interception and clarify the molecular transitions from precancer to cancer.</p>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
        <p id="P13">High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma (HGSOC) is a highly aggressive gynecological cancer, causing over 200,000 deaths worldwide each year<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The absence of early-stage symptoms often results in diagnosis at advanced stages (AJCC Stage III &amp; IV) when the cancer has already spread. The 5-year overall survival rate for patients with advanced disease is less than 30% and has remained unchanged for decades<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Standard treatment includes surgery to reduce tumor burden, followed by chemotherapy, but chemoresistance is common, with over 80% of stage III or IV patients experiencing relapse after initial treatment. This underscores the need for early detection and interception strategies to identify the disease at its earliest stages, reduce recurrence, and improve outcomes<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Women with <italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic> gene mutations are at particularly high risk for developing HGSOC, leading some women to choose preventive surgery, such as bilateral salpingectomy-oophorectomy (BSO) to reduce their risk<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P14">Over the past two decades, studies have shown that HGSOC originates at the distal, fimbriated end of the fallopian tube (FT)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Histopathologic evaluation and next-generation sequencing have recognized two types of precursor lesions for HGSOC: the p53 signature and serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STIC). p53 signatures are benign-appearing stretches of secretory cells with <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations that are non-proliferative and commonly located at the fimbriated end of the FT, regardless of genetic risk. The origin of these p53 signatures is linked to the ‘incessant ovulation hypothesis’, which proposes that continuous ovulation leads to repeated injury to cells near ruptured follicles, including those at the fimbriated end of the FT<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. The repeated injury leads to genetic and epigenetic alterations, transforming p53 signatures into STIC and eventually into invasive cancer<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Incidental STICs discovered during risk-reduction surgeries have been associated with the subsequent development of peritoneal carcinomatosis<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, suggesting that STIC cells may shed from the fimbria before invasion occurs (a precursor escape model<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>). However, the full progression of these precursors to invasive cancer remains complex and is not yet fully understood.</p>
        <p id="P15">Genomic studies have demonstrated a clonal relationship between p53 signatures, STICs, and concurrent HGSOC, with each sharing identical <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Nearly half of HGSOCs exhibit defects in homologous recombination, resulting in genomic instability due to somatic mutations in the <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1/2</italic> genes, epigenetic silencing of <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1/2</italic> promoters, or mutations in other DNA repair factors<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. HGSOC also commonly displays chromosomal instability (CIN), including breakage-fusion-bridge cycles that lead to the amplification of key oncogenes like <italic toggle="yes">CCNE1</italic><sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. DNA methylation analyses further support the FT as the origin of HGSOC, as the methylation profile of HGSOC more closely resembles that of FT epithelium rather than ovarian surface epithelium<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. In addition, HGSOC-specific hypermethylation is present exclusively in the FT epithelium of women with STIC lesions<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Early events in STICs include similar global patterns of copy number alterations, such as <italic toggle="yes">CCNE1</italic> amplification and higher ploidy<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P16">Despite progress in understanding these genetic features, the role of the immune microenvironment in HGSOC development and progression remains underexplored. Among the four subtypes of HGSOC, the immunoreactive subtype, characterized by CD8+ cytotoxic T cell (CTL) infiltration, is associated with a better prognosis<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. By contrast, subtypes such as the C5/PRO subtype often exhibit immune deserts or CTL exclusion, which are linked to poorer outcomes<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Single-cell RNA sequencing of advanced HGSOC has identified several cancer-related pathways, including Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling, the interferon (IFN) response, inflammatory pathways, and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling, all of which correlate with T cell infiltration levels<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. The female reproductive tract (including the FTs) has a highly active immune system, rich in natural killer (NK) and T cells, which are likely involved in maintaining immune tolerance during pregnancy and monitoring microbial infections<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Thus, gaining a better understanding of how the immune microenvironment changes during HGSOC progression could unlock key insights for improving disease diagnosis and management.</p>
        <p id="P17">In this study, we used a multi-omic approach to map the tumor-immune ecosystems during the development and progression of HGSOC. We leveraged several high-plex spatial analysis methods, such as cyclic immunofluorescence (CyCIF<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>), 3D CyCIF<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, and spatial transcriptomics (whole transcriptome analysis, WTA)<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> of human archival tissue specimens to map the spatial distributions, interactions, and molecular programs of different cell types. This data reveals key changes that occur in the tumor microenvironment (TME) as precancer STIC lesions progress to invasive HGSOC. We uncover temporal changes in molecular pathways, including activation of interferon (IFN) signaling, micronuclei (MN) formation and rupture, and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling. CyCIF imaging reveals dynamic shifts in immune cell populations and interactions over the progression axis. Early lesions are defined by immune surveillance, characterized by the presence of conventional dendritic cells Type 1 (cDC1), NK cells, and tissue-resident memory (T<sub>RM</sub>) CD8+ T cells. However, in advanced precursor lesions, we observe a significant decline in these immune cells, along with molecular evidence of immune dysfunction and immune editing. By combining spatially transcriptomics and high-plex imaging, this study highlights the dynamic interplay between immune activation, suppression, and molecular reprogramming during HGSOC progression. We have made our data publicly available and explorable through cBioPortal, providing a widely accessible resource for identifying therapeutic targets and informing early detection strategies.</p>

          <title>Specimen Cohort</title>
          <p id="P18">To investigate the molecular and spatial changes occurring in the fallopian tube (FT) during the early development of high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSOC), we analyzed 44 FT specimens with precursor lesions collected from 43 individuals obtained from a multi-center collaboration (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>-<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). The 44 specimens were collected from patients with various genotypes and disease presentations, which we categorized into two main groups based on the presence or absence of cancer. Specimens in Group 1 (n=24) contained invasive cancer and co-occurring serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (denoted as STIC.C). This included specimens from individuals with and without <italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic> mutations (wild-type (WT) <italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic> 15/24; germline (g) <italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic> n=7/9; g<italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> n=6/7; somatic 2/9) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Specimens in Group 2 (n=19) lacked invasive cancer but contained precursor lesions that were identified during risk-reducing BSO or opportunistic salpingectomy. Group 2 included patients with and without BRCA mutation, and specimens contained incidental p53 signatures (denoted as p53.I, n=10; g<italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic>1 5/10; g<italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic>2 5/10) and incidental STIC lesions (denoted as STIC.I, n=9; g<italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic> 5/9; g<italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic>2 1/5; WT <italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic> 4/9) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>-<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). STIC.I likely represent early time points in clonal evolution, while STIC.C represents later points in the development and progression of STIC lesions<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Of the 44 specimens, all but nine had matched FT and/or fimbriae (Fim) within the same tissue section (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P19">Among the 24 patients with invasive cancer, eight had stage I disease (6/8 with gBRCA mutations). Five of these stage I patients had tumors restricted to the FT, with no involvement of the ovary or spread through the abdomen (peritoneal metastasis) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1A</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B</xref>). The remaining 16 patients had stage II-III disease (13/16 <italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic> WT). Only three cancer patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, while the rest had surgery without prior chemotherapy (treatment-naïve; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Patients with invasive cancer co-occurring with STIC lesions (STIC.C) were much older with a median age (65.5 years, range 46–85) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1C</xref>) than individuals with incidental precursor lesions (p53.I or STIC.I; median age of 47 years, range 34–72). The younger age of individuals with incidental lesions reflects earlier timing of BSO in women with known <italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic> mutations. Overall, this cohort represents the entire spectrum of HGSOC development, enabling the characterization of disease progression (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary File S1</xref>).</p>

To understand the transitions between the stages of HGSOC development, we analyzed the differential gene expression patterns within the epithelium across various stages of the disease using spatial transcriptomics data (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> revealed prominent activation of the IFN pathway (both IFN-α and IFN-ɣ) and cell cycle regulator pathways in the epithelium during early HGSOC development. This activation was evident comparing normal epithelium of incidental FT (FT.I ) and incidental Fimbriae (Fim.I) to p53.I (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S4A</xref>) and p53.I to STIC.I (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P23">As the disease progressed, STIC.C lesions (regardless of BRCA status) displayed further enrichment of the IFN response as well as genes associated with TGF-β signaling, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) signaling via NFκB pathway (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). These pathways were further upregulated in established cancer (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), promoting invasion, motility, stress adaptation, and inflammation. The TGF-β pathway is known to induce EMT and interact with the PIK3K/mTOR or KRAS pathways<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, both of which were activated before or during the STIC.C stage (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>), potentially promoting growth even at early stages. Compared to precursor lesions, established cancer displayed enrichment for genes associated with hedgehog signaling and angiogenesis pathways (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Analysis of the stromal compartment surrounding HGSOC precursors and cancer revealed a similar trend.

          <p id="P24">Since GSEA indicated early activation of the IFN response in HGSOC progression (starting at the p53.I stage), we performed a more detailed analysis of this pathway. We examined specific gene sets related to IFN-α, IFN-ɣ<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, IFN-related DNA damage resistance signature (IRDS)<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> and IFN-epsilon (ε)<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary File S3</xref>).

          <p id="P25">The model confirmed a significant upregulation of key IFN-α/γ pathway genes in p53 signatures (p53.I), STIC lesions (STIC.I and STIC.C), and established cancer compared to matched normal epithelium (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>-<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2J</xref>). This activation included significant upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">STAT1</italic> (an upstream activator of IFN signaling), and IFN-induced and regulatory factors (<italic toggle="yes">IFITM1, IRF9, IRF7</italic>), <italic toggle="yes">with IFITM1</italic> induced even in the Fim.I stage (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>).

Upregulation of key IFN-α/γ pathway genes persisted in STIC.C and cancer cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2J</xref>). Furthermore, both classical (<italic toggle="yes">HLA-A/B/C</italic>) and non-classical (<italic toggle="yes">HLA-E</italic>) MHC-Class I antigen presentation molecules were upregulated in the epithelial compartment of p53.I and STIC.I lesions (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5B</xref>). Collectively, these findings highlight a robust and sustained induction of IFN-α/γ pathway genes that persists throughout HGSOC development, underscoring a potential role in disease progression.</p>
          <p id="P26">Recent studies have shown that the female reproductive tract epithelium, including the FT epithelium, constitutively expresses IFN-ε, a Type-I interferon, for immune defense<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>. Our data revealed a significant decrease in <italic toggle="yes">IFNE</italic> (i.e. IFN-ε transcript expression), <italic toggle="yes">IFNA2</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">IFNA4</italic> expression, in STIC.C and cancer epithelium compared to matched normal epithelium (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S4F</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4G</xref>). However, downregulation of IFN-ε signaling was not observed in incidental precursors, suggesting it occurs later in HGSOC progression, after the initial IFN-α and IFN-ɣ response.</p>
          <p id="P27">Chronic activation of the IFN pathway, known as IRDS, has been linked to chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance in various cancers<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>.

Persistent IFN activation might contribute to the emergence of IRDS, particularly during the later stages of STIC clonal expansion. Overall, the data suggests dynamic shifts in IFN signaling throughout HGSOC progression. Early activation of IFN during the p53 signature stage persists and intensifies as the disease progresses, coinciding with the downregulation of IFN-ε signaling and the emergence of IRDS. These findings indicate a potential link between sustained IFN-α/ɣ activation, clonal selection, and the gradual accumulation of tumor-promoting and immune-suppressive pathways.</p>

          <p id="P28">CyCIF is a multiplexed imaging technique that quantifies protein marker expression at a single-cell level<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>. We used CyCIF to visualize IFN pathway activity within HGSOC precursors. This analysis revealed a stepwise increase in the number of epithelial cells expressing IFN pathway markers (e.g., p-TBK1, p-STATs, HLA-A/E) across disease stages (p53.I: median 22%, STIC.I: 33%, STIC.C: 43%, and cancer: 26%), regardless of BRCA mutation status (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>-<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>-<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref>). High-resolution 3D CyCIF imaging confirmed co-expression of the IFN inducible protein, MX-1, which formed multiple discrete puncta, and the antigen-presenting protein HLA-A within epithelial cells (PanCK+) in STIC.C and invasive cancer (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>), reconfirming IFN induction in MHC-class I + epithelial cells.</p>
          <p id="P29">Despite the observed increase in IFN marker expression with disease progression, there was significant inter- and intra-sample heterogeneity in the presence or absence of IFN pathway markers across all stages (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2A</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>-<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11</xref>). For instance, within the same STIC.I lesion, we observed both HLA-E positive and HLA-E negative cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2A</xref>). In cancer, we also noted variability in the intensity of IFN pathway marker expression, such as the presence of both HLA-E low and high-intensity tumor regions within the same patient (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>). We leveraged this heterogeneity to explore the potential for localized and coordinated IFN signaling in HGSOC precursors. Visual inspection of CyCIF images suggested co-expression of IFN markers within individual cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>). This observation was further supported by pairwise correlation analysis, which demonstrated strong positive correlation between various pairs of IFN markers (e.g., pSTAT1+ HLA-E+; p-STAT1+ p-TBK1+; pSTAT1+ p-STAT3+; p-TBK1+ HLA-E+) across all disease stages (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.5–50, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). While the percentage of cells expressing IFN markers (e.g., HLA-E) was relatively low at early stages (p53.I median: 4%), it increased in STIC.I (16%), STIC.C (26%), and invasive cancer (18%) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S8C</xref>). The high probability of IFN marker co-expression suggests coordinated and localized activation of the IFN pathway throughout HGSOC development. The progressive increase in IFN-positive cells within precursor lesions further implies clonal expansion driven by positive selection during disease progression.</p>

To investigate how the spatial organization of immune cells changes during HGSOC development, we first used CyCIF data to quantify major immune cell types in precursor lesions and invasive cancer (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>-<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). These cell types included: i) antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as conventional dendritic cells Type-1 (cDC1) and macrophage-derived APCs, ii) CD68+ macrophages (M1-like), iii) CD163+ macrophages (M2-like), iv) CD20+ B cells, v) CD4+ T cells, vi) CD8+ T lymphocytes (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>-<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>).

          <p id="P34">We then applied latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a statistical method for topic modeling, to analyze the spatial patterns of the immune microenvironment.

Based on cell type and activation markers, 4.22×10<sup>7</sup> single cells from 44 specimens were classified into 21 distinct groups, revealing recurrent local cellular neighborhoods (‘topics’). These topics represent niches of specialized cell types or interacting cell types that may play a role in disease progression or response to therapy. Several notable recurrent neighborhoods were identified, including Topic 8, which predominantly comprised CD163+ (M2-like) macrophages, Topic 10, dominated by CD11c+ APCs, and Topic 21, characterized by HLA-DR+ (activated) APC cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Each of these neighborhoods was significantly enriched in invasive cancer compared to STIC lesions (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>).

Using CyCIF imaging, we observed that although the total population of CD11c+ APCs (which includes cDC1 cells) increased with disease progression (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>), the number of HLA-DR+ cDC1 cells (indicating antigen presenting function) rose significantly in the early stages, particularly in the epithelium (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>). These cells were 10-fold higher in p53.I epithelium and 15-fold higher in STIC.I epithelium compared to normal epithelium but remained relatively stable with disease progression. In the stroma, cDC1 populations expressing HLA-DR increased 12-fold in STIC.I compared to normal tissues but decreased substantially in more advanced lesions (12-fold decrease in STIC.C and 3-fold in established cancers compared to STIC.I) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>). This suggests that the antigen-presenting function provided by cDC1 decreases as precursor lesions progress. Similarly, NK cells, which were present at low levels in normal tissue and p53.I precursors (median 0.1%), became nearly undetectable in later stages of the disease (STIC.I, STIC.C, and cancer; median: 0.02%) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S17</xref>), indicating a further decline in anti-tumor immunity.</p>
          <p id="P36">To validate these observations, we performed Bayesian modeling of the spatial transcriptomics data to analyze gene sets specific to cDC1 and NK cells<sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary File S3</xref>). This analysis confirmed the CyCIF findings, showing that cDC1 and NK cells are present in early precursors but decrease with disease progression, particularly in STIC.C and tumor stages.

Both CD68+ M1-like macrophages and CD163+ M2-like macrophages became more abundant, reaching their highest levels in invasive cancer (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S19A</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">19B</xref>).

Spatial transcriptomics data further supported the increase in APCs with disease progression. While multiple cell types can produce various chemokines and cytokines (e.g., CXCL9, CCL3 and TNF), the data showed an increasing trend of gene expression associated with both M1 and M2 macrophages<sup><xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref></sup> in the cancer group, including stabilin-1 (<italic toggle="yes">STAB1)</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">AXL</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">IL-10</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CD163</italic> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S21</xref>).

          <title>Shifting Functional Landscape of CD4+ T Cells in HGSOC Development</title>
          <p id="P38">The observed changes in APC composition during HGSOC progression – a decrease in cDC1 and an increase in macrophage-derived APCs – led us to characterize CD4+ T cells, critical partners with APCs in orchestrating adaptive immune responses. CyCIF analysis revealed a progressive increase in CD4+ T cell infiltration throughout the disease course (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S22A</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S22B</xref>). However, both activation and dysfunction markers were observed in these CD4+ T cells. Over 35% of CD4+ T cells expressed either HLA-DR or PD1, suggesting potential antigen presentation and activation, starting from the STIC.I stage (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S22</xref>). At the same time, the presence of numerous regulatory T cells (CD4+ FoxP3+ Tregs: ~14%) and CD4+ LAG3+ (~14%) indicated the development of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and potential dysfunction of antigen presentation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S22A</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S22B</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P39">CD4+ T cell activation relies on antigen presentation by MHC-class II molecules, primarily expressed by APCs. While direct interactions between CD4+ T cells, HLA-DR expressing APCs, and CD8 T cells were observed, there was evidence of a dampening effect – some APCs co-expressed HLA-DR+/CD40+ along with TIM3, an inhibitory receptor that modulates the function of both lymphoid cells and APCs, suggesting a reduced capacity for antigen presentation<sup><xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>–<xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S23</xref>). Quantitative analysis comparing the cell-cell interactions in STIC.I and STIC.C lesions showed decreased proximity (normalized interaction score) between activated CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and cDC1/macrophage-derived APCs expressing HLA-DR in STIC.C lesions (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>). Thus, while CD4 T cells infiltrate HGSOC precursor lesions, their capacity for activation appears to be counterbalanced by the emergence of suppressive mechanisms, potentially contributing to disease progression.</p>

          <p id="P40">We also observed changes in the numbers, activation states, and localization of CD8+ T cells within the tissues during HGSOC development. Compared to normal tissue, CD8+ T cells increased significantly in the epithelium of STIC.I lesions (2-fold) and even more dramatically in the stroma (10-fold) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). However, this increase was followed by a gradual decline in later disease stages (STIC.C and cancer), with a sharper decrease in the epithelium compared to the stroma (2-fold vs. 1.5-fold).</p>
          <p id="P41">Many different CD8+ T cell subsets were present, including tissue-resident memory T cells (T<sub>RM</sub>; CD8+ CD103+ CD45RO+), a specialized subset of CD8+ T cells adapted for localized immune surveillance within specific tissues<sup><xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,<xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref></sup>, and conventional cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTL: CD8+ CD103- CD45RO-). We used markers such as Ki67, PD1, GMZB, TIM3, and LAG3 to assess their functional states (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>-<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). T<sub>RM</sub> cells increased 1.5-fold in p53.I epithelium compared to normal epithelium, but gradually decreased with disease progression (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). CTL numbers started to rise in p53.I, with the most striking increase observed in STIC.I epithelium and stroma, followed by a gradual decrease in STIC.C (4-fold) and cancer (2-fold), particularly in the epithelium (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P42">Although the total number of CD8+ T cells decreased in later stages of HGSOC progression, the remaining CD8+ T cells were more likely to be either activated (PD1+ or Ki67+) or exhausted (LAG3+ or PD1+LAG3+), indicating a balance between active surveillance and T cell dysfunction (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6G</xref>-<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6O</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S24</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S25A</xref>-<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S25D</xref>). While 11% of CD8+ T cells in p53.I showed signs of activation, this fraction rose significantly in STIC.I, STIC.C, and cancer (25–43%). Similarly, exhaustion markers increased in the epithelia compartments (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), with the proportion of exhausted CD8+ T cells rising 3- to 7-fold (~2% were LAG3+ T<sub>RM</sub> CD8 T cells in STIC.I, STIC.C, and cancer; 1% were LAG3+ CTL CD8+ T cells in STIC.C and cancer) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S24A</xref>).

        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p id="P43">We have developed a comprehensive resource of multiplexed imaging and spatial transcriptomics data to study HGSOC development, from precancer lesions (incidental p53 signatures and incidental STICs) to invasive cancer. Our analysis reveals that localized IFN signaling and CIN are early events that increase with progression, accompanied by significant immune microenvironment reorganization. Activated T<sub>RM</sub> and components of the NK-cDC1 axis are already present at the p53 signature stage, indicating early immune surveillance at the inception of HGSOC development in the fallopian tube. This immune response intensifies with increased activated CTL activity in incidental STICs. However, during the transition from incidental STIC to cancer-associated STIC, we observe a significant decrease in the NK-cDC1 axis. This decline coincides with an increase in activated CD8+ T cells, exclusion and dysfunction of these cells, reduced CD4+ T cell-APC interactions, and an increase in Tregs. These findings highlight a dynamic competition between immune surveillance and immune suppression, where initial immune responses in early lesions are progressively countered by immune-suppressive mechanisms as HGSOC progresses (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P44">The molecular heterogeneity observed in precancer lesions offers insights into the interactions between the immune response and precursor phenotypes. Early localized IFN activation in p53 signatures and STICs, combined with the gradual accumulation of tumorigenic programs downstream of cGAS-STING or IFN pathways – such as NFκB, IRDS or IL-6 induced STAT3 pathways<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref></sup> – may drive immune editing and selection in precursor populations. Traditionally this heterogeneity and extensive genomic instability (including MN rupture and catastrophic genomic events that drive genome evolution, immune evasion, and disease spread<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup>) have been viewed as hallmarks of later tumor evolution and chemoresistance<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref></sup>. However, our data suggest that these processes are likely influential much earlier in HGSOC development. This phenotypic variability in STIC lesions, including differences in proliferation and DNA damage, may inform diagnostic risk stratification, by identifying STIC lesions with increased potential for malignant transformation and dissemination<sup><xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,<xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref></sup>. This variability coupled with known genetic alterations in HGSOC, such as 6p loss leading to MHC-class I loss and 6q loss affecting <italic toggle="yes">IFNGR1</italic> (Interferon Gamma Receptor 1)<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,<xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref></sup>, highlights the potential for intricate interplay between genetic mutations, precursor cell phenotypes, and localized immune interactions during cancer development<sup><xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P45">Immune evasion is a critical factor in HGSOC progression. Along the progression axis, IFN signaling coincides with HLA-A expression, responsible for antigen presentation to CTLs. However, upregulation of HLA-E expression may represent a key immune suppression mechanism during STIC clonal expansion. This aligns with findings in other cancers, where high HLA-E expression inhibits NK cell activity by engaging NKG2A receptors, thereby suppressing NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>–<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>. The observed decline in the NK-cDC1 axis and dysfunction in adaptive immunity suggests that targeting NK cell reactivation using therapies like humanized anti-NKG2A antibodies (e.g., Monalizumab<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup>) could be a promising strategy for early intervention, particularly in high-risk patients with incidental STICs linked to peritoneal cancer development<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P46">Immune surveillance, driven by activated NK cells, cDC1, and T<sub>RM</sub> cells, along with elevated <italic toggle="yes">IFNG</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TNF</italic><sup><xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,<xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref></sup> in the adjacent stroma, likely restrains the progression of early lesions, such as p53 signatures. This environment, sustained by feedback established between these immune cells and recruited CTLs, may limit abnormal growth and prevent cancer progression. However, for clonal selection and expansion to occur, additional factors are likely required<sup><xref rid="R95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>–<xref rid="R97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref></sup> over the course of decades<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, such as repeated ovulatory-related stress leading to epithelial damage, increased cell proliferation, and genomic instability<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref></sup>. A shift in the IFN response, from early immune surveillance to chronic stimulation, may further promote IRDS and IFN-ε- suppression<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, supporting DNA damage tolerance and immune suppression. Furthermore, macrophage-derived APCs, while increasing in prevalence in later stages, show reduced interaction with CD4+ T cells, indicating a functional shift that further promotes the transition from activation to immune suppression<sup><xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref></sup>, facilitating the progression to more advanced stages of disease.</p>
        <p id="P47">Our findings align with emerging concepts of precancer hallmarks, including the failure of the NK-CTL axis, evolving immune suppression mechanisms, and microenvironment remodeling that promotes immune evasion<sup><xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="R99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref></sup>. These mechanisms are likely critical drivers of HGSOC development. In addition to offering insights into the temporal and spatial dynamics of the immune landscape and molecular transitions throughout HGSOC progression, this study also provides an accessible and large-scale public resource for further exploration of the interactions between transcriptional changes, cellular phenotypes, and spatial organization of precancer ecosystems. The integration of our spatial transcriptomics and imaging data into cBioPortal will enable future studies to uncover additional mechanisms driving cancer development and progression, ultimately advancing strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment<sup><xref rid="R100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref></sup>.</p>

          <p id="P53">After calculating the average proportion of cells expressing single/double/tripe markers for cell phenotyping on MATLAB, downstream quantification across HGSOC stages, including statistical analysis, was performed in R (v 4.3.3). To test whether proportions of cells with a given phenotype among the whole populations of cells differed between disease stages, we used binomial Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) implemented in the lme4 R package (v 1.1–34)<sup><xref rid="R103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref></sup>. For each ROI, the number of cells with the given phenotype (“successes”) and of all other phenotypes (“failures”) were modelled using the binomial distribution with a logit link function using the lme4 model formula cbind(n_success, n_failure) ~ stage + (1 + stage | patient_id). ROIs were not independent since they were derived from the same patients more than once. To account for this, covariance and patient specific effects were modeled by including random intercepts and stage coefficients for each patient. Post-hoc contrasts between stages were performed using the emmeans R package with Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction for multiple testing. Due to the overdispersion of some immune populations, we used binomial GLMMs implemented in the glmmTMB R package (v 1.1.9)<sup><xref rid="R104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref></sup> for six major subtypes of immune populations. For each ROI, the number of cells with the given phenotype (“successes”) and of all other phenotypes (“failures”) were modelled using the binomial distribution with a logit link function using the glmmTMB model formula cbind(n_success, n_failure) ~ stage + (1 | patient_id) + (1 | observation_id). ROIs were not independent since they were derived from the same patients more than once. To account for this, covariance and patient specific effects were modeled by including random intercepts and stage coefficients for each patient. Overdispersion was controlled for by including an observation-level random effect (OLRE)<sup><xref rid="R105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref></sup>.

          <title>To model the progression of HGSOC using published gene set by Bayesian Regression Modelling</title>
          <p id="P61">To study the relationship between gene expression and cancer lesion progression we employed a Bayesian ordinal regression model implemented by the brms R package<sup><xref rid="R109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref></sup>. We preprocessed GeoMx expression counts by Q3 normalized to account for sequencing depth, followed by log10 transformation to stabilize variances. To account for differences in expression levels across genes, we further normalized the log-transformed values by scaling to a mean of zero and variance of one (z-transform). We fitted one model per gene using the model specification gene_expression ~ mo(stage) + (1 + mo(stage) | patient_id) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S13</xref>). The lesion stage was used as ordinal predictor mo(stage) with a monotonic constraint to enforce the assumption of an orderly sequence of stages. We accounted for repeat measurements from the same patients by including patient-specific random intercepts and stage coefficients. To model expression of gene sets, we modified the model to include another random effect and its interaction with patient_id (gene_expression ~ mo(stage) + (1 + mo(stage) | patient_id * gene). This modification allows every patient and gene to have a different expression baseline and expression changes at each disease stage. The ‘*’ operator between patient and gene enables genes to behave differently in every patient (i.e., interaction). As a result, we can look at the expression along with the progression axis as a gene set, such as the IRDS gene set shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S13E</xref>. To investigate the effect of HLA-E expression on other genes, we further modified the model to include a fixed effect coefficient serving as binary indicator for presence or absence of HLA-E in the CyCIF image of the ROI (gene_expression ~ mo(stage) * hlae_e + (1 + mo(stage) * hlae_e | patient_id * gene). We tested this modified model first to confirm whether HLA-E expression in protein and RNA levels match. <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S13C</xref> indicates that HLA-E RNA expression is higher in clones that are HLA-E+ by CyCIF, including an increased trend observed from FT.C to cancer. For significance testing, we used the proportion of the 95% highest density interval (HDI) within the Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE, 0.05 times the standard deviation). Comparisons with &gt;95% of the HDI outside the ROPE were significant (*), while those with &gt;99% were considered very significant (**)<sup><xref rid="R110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref></sup>. In most cases, matched FT was chosen as a reference, meaning p53.I and STIC.I were compared to FT.I, and STIC.C and cancer were compared to FT.C. One exception was the stromal component from the cancer group, where we used p53.C as a reference due to the unavailability of normal FT or Fimbriae from this group.</p>

          <p id="P77"><bold>A.</bold> Differential gene expression between epithelial segments of p53.I (n=39) and STIC.I (n=27). Linear Mixed Model (LMM) was applied for differential gene expression. LMM was performed with Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction using GeoMx DSP software (NanoString, v 3.1.0.221). Model formula: Lesions Type + (1| Scan_ID) whereby Scan_ID refers to the patient/slide ID. Only a subset of differentially expressed genes are shown.</p>
          <p id="P78"><bold>B-D.</bold> Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed based on the differential gene expression of the epithelia (as analyzed by GeoMx DSP software). MsigDB Cancer Hallmark gene sets associated with disease progression were compared between <bold>(B)</bold> p53.I (n=39) and STIC.I (n=27), <bold>(C)</bold> STIC.I (n=27) and STIC.C (n=96), and <bold>(D)</bold> STIC.C (n=96) and invasive carcinoma (n=105). Progression of STIC.I <bold>(B)</bold> was predominantly associated with interferon (IFN) and proliferative gene sets; STIC.C <bold>(C)</bold> was predominantly associated with EMT, TGF-β and hypoxia gene sets, and invasive carcinoma only events <bold>(D)</bold> were most likely to be associated with angiogenesis and Hedgehog signaling pathway. B-D. Pathway rankings were based on an adjusted p-value &lt;0.05.</p>
          <p id="P79"><bold>E-J.</bold> Since LMMs and GSEA only allow us to look into pairwise comparison, we employed Bayesian regression modeling to model the progression from FT to cancer. Notably, Bayesian models differ from other methods since they take repeated sampling from the same patient into consideration.</p>
          <p id="P80"><bold>E.</bold> LMMs account for patient variability, demonstrated using a synthetic gene expression dataset across two disease stages. Repeated sampling from a single patient (Patient 1) introduces bias in estimating the mean effect. This bias is eliminated when patient variability is incorporated using LMMs.</p>
          <p id="P81"><bold>F.</bold> Bayesian ordinal regression models for gene expression across disease progression, exemplified using <italic toggle="yes">MCL1</italic>. While LMMs in the GeoMx DSP software allow only pairwise comparisons and a single random effect, Bayesian ordinal regression enables analysis across multiple disease stages. We implemented this approach using the “brms” R package, incorporating an ordinal monotonic constraint to model the stepwise sequence of lesions during disease progression<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. GeoMx expression counts were Q3 normalized to account for sequencing depth (see <xref rid="S16" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) and log transformed to stabilize variances. To account for differences in expression levels across different genes, the log-transformed values were further normalized by scaling to a mean of zero and variance of one (z-transform). We fitted one model per gene using the model specification gene_expression ~ mo(stage) + (1 + mo(stage) | patient_id). A monotonic constraint was applied to enforce the assumption of an orderly sequence of these stages<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Repeat measurements from the same patients were accounted for by including patient-specific random intercepts and stage coefficients. In order to model the expression of gene sets, another random effect and its interaction with patient_id was included in the model (gene_expression ~ mo(stage) + (1 + mo(stage) | patient_id * gene) (details are in <xref rid="S16" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P82"><bold>G-J.</bold> In order to look into more details of IFN pathway and how it changes from normal FT to STIC.I or STIC.C to carcinoma, Bayesian ordinal regression model was applied to selected IFN-hallmark genes to compare expression changes in the epithelial and stromal compartments at different disease stages. Bayesian modeling allows to see the relative gene expression changes in the incidental or cancer group compared to the matched FT. Heatmaps show normalized expression of genes in the epithelia related to response in (G) IFN-α, (H) IFN-ɣ, from incidental group compared to their matched FT.I. Relative to the matched FT.I, upregulation of key genes induced by both IFN-α and IFN-ɣ activation, such as <italic toggle="yes">STAT1, ISG15, IFITM1, IRF7, IRF9, HLA-A</italic> at p53.I, indicating IFN activation at the very early stages of HGSOC progression. Heatmap showing normalized expression of genes in the epithelia related to response in (I) IFN-α, (J) IFN-ɣ, from cancer group compared to their matched FT.C. G-J.

          <p id="P114"><bold>A.</bold> Lollipop plot shows the relative difference (fold difference) of major immune cells and state between STIC.I and STIC.C. Epithelial and stroma regions are both shown. The fold difference is calculated from the average proportion of each cell state (proportion of STIC.C/STIC.I). Fold difference of 1 indicates no change, &gt;1 indicates that cell type is higher in STIC.C and &lt;1 indicates higher in STIC.I.</p>
          <p id="P115"><bold>B.</bold> This schematic illustrates the stages of HGSOC progression, highlighting the temporal evolution of cancer hallmarks and immune-precancer/cancer interactions. Cancer arises from genetic alterations, where mutations and aneuploidy, and other cancer hallmarks, under positive selection, lead to tumor development. However, cells with oncogenic mutations can remain latent for decades, and most never progress to malignancy. Evidence suggests that cancer originates from these “phenotypically normal” clones with driver mutations, followed by a clonal expansion. Along the progression axis, these clonally expanded cells accumulate additional mutations and encounter a gradual decline in anti-tumor responses, with an increase in immune-suppressive and dysfunctional immune cell subtypes. Our multimodal precancer atlas profiling shows how the TME evolves over time. Early in precursor development, cytotoxic immune responses emerge despite lower genomic instability compared to advanced tumors. Innate immune mechanisms (NK-cDC1-CTL axis) and tissue-resident memory T cells (T<sub>RM</sub>) play a key role in controlling p53 signature outgrowth. Aneuploidy or extrinsic factors enhance immune surveillance, removing precancer cells before disease outgrowth. During early STIC clonal expansion, we observe an initial immune response characterized by IFN activation, an increase in activated cDC1 and activated APCs, and the presence of NK cell secreted chemokines (which further attracts cDC1), indicating active immune surveillance. Interactions between APCs and activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells provide further evidence of immune engagement. However, suppressive immune populations, such as M2-like macrophages and Tregs, emerge during this stage; STIC in this equilibrium phase simultaneously experience a cytotoxic and immunosuppressive environment with activation of tumor-promoting pathways. Late-stage clonal expansion has fewer CD8+ T cells with less interaction with APC and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, more exhausted CD8+CTL and CD4+ (LAG3+), almost no NK and cDC1 cells, and increased suppressive APC. Overall, the transition from STIC to tumor is driven by hallmark mechanisms, such as TGF-β, which exclude CTLs, altered cytokines and fibroblast profiles, and induction of EMT and migration programs. The dotted arrows represent hypothetical timing, with the transition from p53 signature to early STIC taking longer than the progression from early to late STIC.</p>
