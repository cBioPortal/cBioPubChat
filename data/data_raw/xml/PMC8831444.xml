          <title>Abstract</title>
          <p>Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) represent a major therapeutic vulnerability for breast cancer. The kinases are clinically targeted via ATP competitive inhibitors (CDK4/6i); however, drug resistance commonly emerges over time. To understand CDK4/6i resistance, we surveyed over 1,300 breast cancers and identified several genetic alterations (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">FAT1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic> loss) converging on upregulation of CDK6. Mechanistically, we demonstrate CDK6 causes resistance by inducing and binding CDK inhibitor INK4 proteins (e.g., p18<sup>INK4C</sup>). <italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic> binding and kinase assays together with physical modeling reveal that the p18<sup>INK4C</sup>–cyclin D–CDK6 complex occludes CDK4/6i binding while only weakly suppressing ATP binding. Suppression of INK4 expression or its binding to CDK6 restores CDK4/6i sensitivity. To overcome this constraint, we developed bifunctional degraders conjugating palbociclib with E3 ligands. Two resulting lead compounds potently degraded CDK4/6, leading to substantial antitumor effects <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, demonstrating the promising therapeutic potential for retargeting CDK4/6 despite CDK4/6i resistance.</p>

            <title>Significance:</title>
            <p>CDK4/6 kinase activation represents a common mechanism by which oncogenic signaling induces proliferation and is potentially targetable by ATP competitive inhibitors. We identify a CDK6–INK4 complex that is resilient to current-generation inhibitors and develop a new strategy for more effective inhibition of CDK4/6 kinases.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Antagonism of oncogenic kinases through small-molecule ATP-competitive inhibitors has been a widely successful strategy for anticancer therapy. Unfortunately, drug resistance is frequently encountered and is often commonly due to genetic alterations that lead to kinase reactivation and drug insensitivity (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1, 2</xref>). Among the most common mechanisms of kinase reactivation are somatic point mutations in the target kinase domain that remodel the drug binding pocket, thereby increasing its relative affinity to ATP over drugs. Examples of such mutations include T790M in <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>-driven lung cancer (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and T315I in <italic toggle="yes">BCR–ABL</italic>-driven leukemia (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4, 5</xref>), among many others. ATP-competitive CDK4/6 kinase inhibitors (CDK4/6i) have led to major improvements in the survival of patients with breast cancer and have shown early signs of efficacy in several other cancer types (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Resistance to these drugs has been studied by many groups, but surprisingly, not a single instance of point mutation in CDK4 or CDK6 kinase has been described from thousands of tumors sequenced (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5–8</xref>). In previous studies, we and others have found that upregulation of CDK6 promotes resistance to CDK4/6i (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref>). In this study, we investigate the basis for CDK6-mediated resistance and find that upregulation of this kinase leads to a distinctive mechanism to increase the relative affinity of the kinase toward ATP over drug. Overexpression of CDK6 causes the upregulation of and binding to INK4 proteins, which then serve as strong competitive inhibitors of the drug but only weak competitive inhibitors of ATP. Thus, overexpression of CDK6 leads to a kinase-weak but drug-insensitive complex that persistently drives G1 progression and cancer growth. To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel set of bifunctional degraders that can effectively bind CDK6, in part through allosteric contacts. In particular, a degrader that is able to bind and degrade both CDK4 and CDK6 is identified and demonstrates activity in cancers resistant to first-generation CDK4/6i.</p>

          <title>INK4 Proteins Interact with CDK6 in CDK4/6i-Resistant Cells</title>
          <p>Previous studies have identified upregulation of wild-type (WT) CDK6 expression as a recurrent mechanism by which tumors restore cell proliferation during CDK4/6i therapy (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref>). To determine if overexpression of CDK6 leads to reactivation of G1 checkpoint kinase activity, we immunoprecipitated CDK4 and CDK6 from isogenic drug-sensitive (MCF7 parental cells with low CDK6) and drug-resistant (MCF7 FAT1-loss cells with high CDK6) cells (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and assayed their kinase activity using RB substrate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S1A). As expected, drug-sensitive cells displayed higher basal levels of expression and activity of CDK4 compared with CDK6. By contrast, drug-resistant CDK6-high cells had similar levels of CDK4 and CDK6 kinase activity. Pretreatment of cells with abemaciclib potently inhibited the kinase activity of CDK4 in both sensitive (84% reduced compared with untreated) and resistant (82%) cells but could only partially reduce CDK6 activity (48%) in resistant cells despite the near-equal IC<sub>50</sub> derived from using recombinant CDK4 (2 nmol/L) and CDK6 (5 nmol/L) kinases, as previously reported (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). As the composition of CDK4/6 complexes with specific members (e.g., D-cyclin, p16, p21, p27) can modify kinase activity and drug response (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12–17</xref>), we investigated CDK4- and CDK6-interacting proteins by immunoprecipitation (IP) of CDK4 and CDK6 from drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells followed by mass spectrometry (MS). Across three replicates, we identified seven proteins that were found in association with CDK6, but not CDK4, in CDK4/6i-resistant cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Among proteins known to interact with CDK4/6 and regulate cell cycle, the INK4 proteins p15<sup>INK4B</sup> and p18<sup>INK4C</sup> (parental cells lack endogenous p16<sup>INK4A</sup>) appeared as the top two that associated with CDK6 but not CDK4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). We verified these findings by IP and immunoblotting and again found that both p15<sup>INK4B</sup> and p18<sup>INK4C</sup> associate with CDK6 in the resistant CDK6-high MCF7 FAT1CR cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S1B). We verified this strong association in other INK4<sup>+</sup>/CDK6-expressing breast cancer cell lines that were resistant to CDK4/6i (Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D). Of note, we observed that the INK4-associated CDK6 was an active kinase by demonstrating its phosphorylation of RB (Supplementary Fig. S1E). Consistent with previous data, expression of the INK4 proteins was also upregulated in resistant cells compared with sensitive cells (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Finally, we conducted an unbiased screen of over 1,000 cell lines (PRISM) and found INK4 overexpression (along with RB1 loss) to be among the top genomic alterations associated with CDK4/6i resistance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). These data reveal that INK4 proteins strongly associate with CDK6 in CDK6-high cells that are resistant to CDK4/6i (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p>

          <title>Interaction of INK4s and CDK6 Promotes Resistance to CDK4/6i</title>
          <p>Based on previous crystallographic structures of CDK6–INK4 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19, 20</xref>), we selected candidate residues in CDK6 that are in proximity of the INK4 binding site and performed site-directed mutagenesis of apparent CDK6–INK4 interface residues. By coimmunoprecipitation, we confirmed that V16D and R31C alterations disrupted the interaction of CDK6 with p15<sup>INK4B</sup> and p18<sup>INK4C</sup> but with intact kinase activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S1F). By contrast, classical kinase-dead mutations (K43M and D163N), far from the interface, did not disrupt the interaction. Consistent with a functional role for the INK4 interaction in drug resistance, mutations in the CDK6–INK4 interface decreased phosphorylation of RB and downstream signaling in response to abemaciclib and palbociclib to the same extent as kinase-dead mutations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). Cell viability assays also showed restored cellular sensitivity to abemaciclib in cells expressing mutant forms of CDK6 impaired at binding INK4 (R31C or V16D; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). These finding were recapitulated in multiple estrogen receptor (ER)–positive breast cancer cell lines, including MCF7, T47D, ZR-75-1, CAMA1, and EFM19 (Supplementary Fig. S1G–S1N). Moreover, overexpression of WT but not mutant forms of CDK6 (R31C or D163N) reduced the accumulation of cells in G1 after treatment with abemaciclib or palbociclib (Supplementary Fig. S1O–S1Q). To confirm the role of INK4 proteins in mediating drug resistance, we genetically knocked out <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2B</italic> (p15) and <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2C</italic> (p18) in CDK6-high cells and found that p18<sup>INK4C</sup> loss could partially restore the responsiveness of RB phosphorylation to abemaciclib treatment, whereas loss of both p15<sup>INK4B</sup> and p18<sup>INK4C</sup> could do so almost entirely (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>). Concordantly, long-term growth assays demonstrated that the loss of INK4 proteins rendered CDK6-high cells sensitive to CDK4/6i. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1L</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S1R and S1S). Conversely, overexpression of p16<sup>INK4A</sup> in T47D cells lowered the potency of both abemaciclib and palbociclib (Supplementary Fig. S1T and S1U). Taken together, these data implicate a drug-insensitive INK4–CDK6 complex in driving persistent RB phosphorylation in CDK4/6i-resistant tumors.</p>

          <p>To elucidate structural mechanisms underlying the effect of INK4 proteins on CDK6 drug inhibition, we inspected existing CDK6 structures alone [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 2EUF; ref. <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] or in complex with INK4s (listed in the table of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). Structural superimposition indicates that the N-lobe of CDK6 is twisted toward cyclin D upon binding of INK4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). We found that INK4 (p16, p18, or p19) binding to CDK6 caused distortion of the N-lobe of CDK6, thereby more significantly decreasing the effective binding pocket volume for CDK4/6i than for AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). This effect is most prominent in p18-bound CDK6, in which p18 binding causes a drastic reduction of the CDK4/6i binding volume (−87.65% for abemaciclib and −85.03% for palbociclib) but minimally affects the binding volume of AMP-PNP (+0.54%; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). The p16-bound CDK6 (−87.44%/−7.64%) and p19-bound CDK6 (−62.36%/−32.05%) led to similar reductions in abemaciclib and AMP-PNP binding volumes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). The reduction of binding pocket volume upon association of INK4 compellingly explains the impaired CDK4/6i inhibition and residual kinase activity in the presence of INK4 observed in our biochemical assays. To directly test whether p18<sup>INK4C</sup> alters the binding affinity of CDK4/6i to CDK6, we performed microscale thermophoresis (MST) assays and found the K<sub>d</sub> of abemaciclib to CDK6 was increased fourfold in the presence of p18<sup>INK4C</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Taken together, these data reveal that the addition of p18<sup>INK4C</sup> to the cyclin D–CDK6 complex suppresses CDK4/6i binding, likely mediating drug resistance.</p>

          <title>Multiple Genetic Alterations Lead to CDK6-Mediated Resistance in Patients</title>
          <p>To define the prevalence of the CDK6-high, CDK4/6i-resistant state in clinically relevant samples, we analyzed CDK6 and INK4 protein expression by immunohistochemistry, using a panel of patient-derived ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer xenografts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We found that among 14 distinct models, eight models displayed intense CDK6 staining. Of these, seven of eight were found to be resistant to CDK4/6i (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Based on our prior work establishing Hippo pathway suppression as a mechanism of CDK6 upregulation (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), we further analyzed FAT1 and nuclear YAP protein levels in these samples and indeed found that a subset of high-CDK6 tumors featured low FAT1, high nuclear YAP1, and high p15/p18 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S3A). However, high CDK6 was found in some FAT1 WT tumors as well, suggesting that additional genetic alterations might promote high CDK6 expression. Indeed, both PTEN and ARID1A have been implicated as potential regulators of this pathway; therefore, we tested whether loss of these might also increase CDK6 abundance (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23, 24</xref>). Knockdown of either PTEN or ARID1A in CDK4/6i-sensitive cell lines led to upregulation of CDK6 expression and resistance to abemaciclib (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>–<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">G</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S3B). Given the canonical role of PTEN in suppressing AKT activation, we tested the effects of the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 and found its administration suppressed the expression of CDK6 in PTEN knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). With respect to ARID1A and its known role in sequestering YAP (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), we found that knockdown of YAP reduced CDK6 expression in the ARID1A knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). Moreover, we found an induction of INK4 protein expression concomitant with CDK6 upregulation in both PTEN and ARID1A knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">I</xref>), suggesting that coordinate upregulation of INK4 and CDK6 may be responsible for mediating drug resistance in this context. Given these results, we analyzed the genomic landscape of 1,366 metastatic tumors from 1,115 patients with hormone receptor (HR)<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>−</sup> metastatic breast cancer (MSK-IMPACT) and found that 190 out of 1,115 (17%) patients showed at least one of the genetic alterations that might be associated with CDK6 upregulation and resistance to CDK4/6i (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>). These findings demonstrate that mutations that can promote a CDK6–INK4 complex represent a significant cohort of patients in whom current ATP-competitive CDK4/6i may prove ineffective.</p>

          <title>Degraders Targeting CDK6 Complexes Inhibit Resistant Cells</title>
          <p>As the INK4–CDK6 complex confers resistance to the current generation of CDK4/6i, we explored the potential of other compounds to target this pathway. Recently, bifunctional degraders [proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC)] have emerged as a promising approach to target “undruggable” proteins and overcome resistance to small-molecule inhibitors (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25, 26</xref>). We previously identified the selective CDK6 degrader BSJ-03-123 (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and here examined its effect in CDK6-high, CDK4/6i-resistant cells. BSJ-03-123 led to dose-dependent degradation of CDK6 but had no effect on CDK4. As a result, BSJ-03-123 could inhibit the phosphorylation of RB and expression of downstream cell-cycle signaling components (e.g., cyclin A2 and E2F1) in CDK4/6i-resistant cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). However, when the same cells were grown in long-term culture with effective CDK6 inhibition or knockdown (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), we did not observe significant growth suppression due to preserved CDK4 activity (Supplementary Fig. S4A). We thus generated a panel of CDK4/6-selective degraders by linking palbociclib to Cereblon (CRBN) binding (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) or von Hippel-Landau (VHL) binding ligands (Supplementary Fig. S4B). All the chemical synthesis information is provided in Supplementary Data. Among these, BSJ-05-017 and BSJ-03-096 showed the highest potency in degrading CDK4 and CDK6, acting at doses as low as 10 nmol/L (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S4C and S4D). The two compounds demonstrated effective inhibition of the phosphorylation of RB and the expression of E2F1–cyclin A2 in both CDK4/6i-sensitive and CDK4/6i-resistant cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S4E and S4F). The degradation of CDK4 and CDK6 was abolished due to loss of binding to VHL with a reversal of the two chiral centers in the VHL ligand (Supplementary Fig. S4G; ref. <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). To assess the therapeutic potential of BSJ-05-017 in CDK6-driven cells, we performed cell proliferation assays and found BSJ-05-017 to be equipotent in suppressing proliferation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S4H) and inducing cell-cycle arrest and senescence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S4I) of CDK4/6i-sensitive and CDK4/6i-resistant breast cancer cells. To understand how these degraders could induce degradation and do so despite the presence of INK4, we manually constructed atomic-level molecular models of CDK4/6 complexed with degraders: E3 ligase adapter pairs (BSJ-03-123: CRBN, BSJ-05-017: VHL) in the presence of p18 or p27 and cyclin D based on existing crystallographic data and previously reported PROTAC degrader binding models (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12, 22</xref>). The E3 ligase adapters shifted ∼0.5 nm from their initial conformation to adopt a new stable conformation in all four models (Supplementary Fig. S4J). To dissect the binding patterns of each of the ternary complex models, hydrogen bonds between the CDKs and the E3 ligase adapters or the degraders were identified for each simulation trajectory (Supplementary Fig. S4K and S4L). Comparing the CRBN/CDK4 versus CRBN/CDK6 conformations, it appears that CDK4 and CDK6 are engaging distinct regions of the CRBN surface with minimal overlap. The CDK6 binding region on the CRBN surface is closer to the binding pocket of BSJ-03-123, and one of the key residues identified here, H353, was previously reported to be important for CRBN to recruit and interact with various substrates (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30–32</xref>). By contrast, CDK4 engages a set of CRBN residues that are distal to the degrader binding pocket. This difference potentially explains the selective degradation of CDK6 over CDK4 induced by BSJ-03-123. To investigate how both BSJ-03-123 and BSJ-05-017 target CDK6, we examined the modeled binding modes of the degrader warhead to CDK6 in complex with E3 ligase adapters in detail. There is minimal interaction between BSJ-03-123 and the kinase binding pocket (no interaction with CDK6 and only one h-bond with the hinge region V101 in CDK4; top row of Supplementary Fig. S4L). Instead, the stabilization of the ternary complex and the effective degradation of CDK6 appear to result from protein–protein interactions between CRBN and CDK6. In the case of the BSJ-05-017 (bottom row of Supplementary Fig. S4L), the degrader appears to partially interact with the kinase binding pocket [F164 in CDK6 and D163 in CDK4, both residues in the Asp–Phe–Gly (DFG) motif] despite the distorted binding pocket and DFG-out conformation of CDK6 in the presence of INK4. In this case, both the degrader–CDK interactions and VHL–CDK interactions contribute to the stabilization of the complex, explaining the robust CDK degradation by BSJ-05-017 observed experimentally. The capacity of these molecules to effectively degrade CDK6 is also consistent with prior reports that even PROTAC compounds with weak ligand binding affinity for the target protein can still achieve formation of a stable complex through additional interactions, leading to potent protein degradation (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p>

          <p>To ascertain the potential for <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> use of BSJ-05-017 and BSJ-03-096, we assessed its pharmacokinetic (PK) properties following a single dose in mice intraperitoneally or per os (PO). Both BSJ-05-017 and BSJ-03-096 displayed high drug exposure in plasma, achieving a C<sub>max</sub> of 2.6 μmol/L and 0.9 μmol/L, respectively, as well as good metabolic stability, as near equivalent to ribociclib at 20 mg/kg in a previous report (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). At 24 hours postdosing, the compound's concentration remained near 100 nmol/L, still above the IC<sub>50</sub> for <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> CDK4/6 degradation (Supplementary Fig. S4M). Given these promising results, we next evaluated the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> effects of both compounds in CDK6-low and CDK6-high cell-derived xenografts. Compared with the vehicle control, BSJ-05-017 induced near-complete degradation of CDK4 and CDK6, leading to significant suppression of RB1 phosphorylation and E2F1 expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). In the long term, MCF7 parental cell–derived xenografts with low CDK6 expression were sensitive to ribociclib, BSJ-05-017, and BSJ-03-096, whereas CDK6-overexpressing and shPTEN xenografts were durably inhibited by BSJ-03-096 (−68.9% and −54.9%) and BSJ-05-017 (−64.9% and −47.4%) while showing tumor outgrowth after initial response to ribociclib (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). These results reveal that in multiple models of CDK4/6i resistance, more potent and complete inhibition of the CDK4/6 kinases has substantial antitumor effects.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>In this report, we uncover how CDK6 evades kinase inhibition by current-generation ATP-competitive CDK4/6i through the cloaking of its ATP binding pocket by INK4 proteins. The results reveal a surprising mechanism of drug resistance to a broadly effective therapy by means of induction of an endogenous tumor suppressor and weak inhibitor of the very oncogenic kinase that the drug is targeting. Through a structural understanding of how this complex generates drug-insensitive signaling, we identify a strategy toward next-generation therapies that can overcome this CDK6–INK4 complex and exert more uniform CDK4/6 inhibition.</p>
        <p>The finding of induction of CDK6 as a recurrent mechanism of resistance to CDK4/6i (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8–10, 35</xref>) is surprising inasmuch as the drugs all potently bind and antagonize both recombinant CDK4 and CDK6. To resolve this conundrum, we investigated the protein complexes of CDK4 and CDK6 present in sensitive and resistant cells. Kinase pulldowns from CDK4/6i-sensitive models manifest high levels of intrinsic CDK4 activity that is CDK4/6i sensitive but express very little CDK6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). By contrast, CDK4/6i-resistant models manifest high expression of CDK6, and this activity is CDK4/6i resistant. These results highlighted a critical difference between CDK4 and CDK6 present in resistant cells, which we resolved through study of the protein–protein interaction profiles of these kinases. We identified an abundant CDK6–INK4 complex in multiple CDK4/6i-resistant ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer cell lines, which was notable given the known binding site for INK4 at the entrance to the CDK4/6 ATP binding pocket (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36–38</xref>). We established the significance of this interaction in mediating CDK4/6i resistance by blocking the interaction through mutation of CDK6 or knockdown of INK4, both of which eliminated drug resistance. Moreover, we reconstituted the complex using recombinant CDK6 and p18<sup>INK4C</sup>, demonstrating that addition of INK4 could almost completely prevent CDK4/6i from suppressing CDK6 activity. These data point to a CDK6–INK4 complex that harbors low but drug-insensitive kinase activity. Such a result is analogous to other forms of drug resistance, in which moving from complete to only partial kinase blockade is enough to allow tumor escape (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3, 39</xref>).</p>
        <p>To develop therapies capable of inhibiting this INK4–CDK6 complex, we generated structural models that could inform how INK4 was affecting drug and ATP binding. Taking advantage of a panel of INK4- or drug-bound CDK4 and CDK6 crystal structures, we were able to develop refined molecular simulations of how INK4 might alter ATP or CDK4/6i binding. The results readily explained the biochemical findings, revealing that INK4 proteins cause distortion of the N-lobe of CDK6 in a manner that disrupts the CDK4/6i binding pocket volume up to 80 times more than it does to the ATP pocket volume. Biophysical measurements by MST confirmed that p18<sup>INK4C</sup> indeed decreased CDK6 binding affinity to CDK4/6i. These findings suggest that new strategies toward inhibiting CDK6–INK4 might turn attention to locations other than the currently targeted drug binding pocket.</p>
        <p>One approach to potentially enhance inhibition of refractory targets is through PROTAC molecules that induce target degradation (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27, 34</xref>). This emerges due to (i) potentially different requirements for the affinity necessary for a drug to inhibit enzymatic activity compared with drug inducing E3 ligase recognition, (ii) vulnerabilities of certain proteins based on their half-lives to degradation compared with catalytic inhibition, and (iii) potential allosteric interactions between the larger PROTAC molecules with other portions of the target driving binding and efficacy. To test this approach for CDK6–INK4, we generated a small library of selective and potent CDK4/6 PROTACs and identified compounds that could specifically target CDK4, CDK6, or both. Using these compounds in our sensitive and resistant models, we demonstrated that degradation of CDK6 is feasible. Importantly, effective inhibition of both CDK4 and CDK6 through degradation led to potent tumor growth inhibition in CDK4/6i-resistant tumor models. Whether achieving such levels of degradation will be safe and tolerable in the clinic is unknown, as other bifunctional degraders (e.g., targeting androgen receptor) are only beginning to be assessed in early-phase trials; however, the data in murine models suggest that intraperitoneal and PO dosing can lead to effective circulating drug concentrations and target inhibition in xenografted tumors. Importantly, the findings convey that those alternative strategies that seek to overcome the INK4–CDK6 complex may represent a substantial therapeutic advance and even lead to efficacy in tumor types in which expression of CDK6 is intrinsically high. Notable in this regard is that many of the “acquired” genetic alterations that lead to CDK6 upregulation in ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) are present as early events in cancers such as lung, endometrial, or prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>The efficacy of the compounds is particularly notable in providing the very first proof that “retargeting” CDK4/6 kinases can show efficacy even after resistance to first-generation CDK4/6i emerges. This may be of relevance for several mechanisms of resistance to first-generation CDK4/6i, as we find a variety of genetic alterations can lead to induction of CDK6, including <italic toggle="yes">FAT1</italic> loss (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> loss (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40–42</xref>), and <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic> loss (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Beyond these alterations, recent literature has pointed to resistance to CDK4/6i through genetic alterations in <italic toggle="yes">CCNE1</italic> (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), and <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic> (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The extent to which these and other alterations (other than RB1) maintain a CDK4/6-dependent checkpoint will need to be investigated using such new-generation CDK4/6i as presented here. Taken together, our results imply that use of current-generation CDK4/6i should be informed by the presence or absence of CDK6–INK4 complexes and reveal the broader therapeutic potential for strategies that promote complete downregulation of both CDK4 and CDK6.</p>

A standard multimer/diaminobenzidine (DAB) detection protocol was performed on a Ventana BenchMark ULTRA Automated stainer, as previously described (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), with appropriate negative and positive controls. Then, 2 μg/mL FAT1 (#ab190242; Abcam), 1 μg/mL YAP (#14074; Cell Signaling Technology), 1 μg/mL CDK6 (#HPA002637; Sigma-Aldrich), 1 μg/mL p15 (#MAB6798; R&amp;D Systems) and 1 μg/mL p18 (#2896; Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies were used. Images were taken under a Leica DMi8 microscope and evaluated by a pathologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Quantification of the staining was based on the percentage of positive staining and staining intensity at the indicated location. The immunoreactive scores were recorded as previously described (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49, 50</xref>).</p>

Structural superposition was performed using UCSF-Chimera v1.14. For each structure, we docked AMP-PNP and palbociclib into the CDK6 binding pocket using the flexible docking protocol in the software DOCK6.9 (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). We also used DOCK6.9 to generate spheres (i.e., probes along the protein surface) and selected those that were occupied by the predicted binding pose of the ligand to approximate the volume of the binding pocket. We elected to use the docked pose for AMP-PNP and the superposed pose for palbociclib due to incomplete pose generation in the distorted binding pocket.

            <title>Manual Construction of the Structural Models of the Ternary Complex</title>
            <p>We used various existing structures (WT, human proteins) from the PDB to construct the complex. The catalytic domains of CDK6 and CDK4 were from PDB IDs 1G3N and 3G33, respectively. CRBN was from PDB ID 5FQD, and VHL was from PDB ID 5T35. Cyclin D1 was from PDB ID 6P8E. For each PROTAC degrader, first, the two warheads were docked to the binding pocket of the E3 ligase adapter and CDK4 (superposed for CDK6 due to the distorted binding pocket). Each palbociclib posed in the CDK binding pockets was then relaxed with a short (20 ns) molecular dynamics simulation (at 310.15 K, 1.0 atm, 4 fs time steps with heavy hydrogen masses, to further open the pocket to increase compatibility with the degrader linker) using OpenMM package v7.4.2 (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Then the docked poses for the two warheads were superimposed to common rotatable bonds in an extended pose of the degrader linker using UCSF-Chimera v1.14. Once clashes in the protein targets were eliminated by manual rotation and reorientation of side chains, the two warheads and the linker were manually bonded.</p>

The small-molecule ligands were parameterized using the GAFF force field (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) and the AM1-BCC charging method (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) implemented in the software package Antechamber (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>).

Short equilibration (5 ns) was performed before the production run (ended up with ∼300 ns) using the Langevin integrator at 400.15 K and 1.0 atm with a time step of 4 fs (using heavy hydrogens with a mass of 4 atomic mass units). The arbitrarily high temperature (127°C) was used for the simulations to ensure that the complexes were not trapped in initial conformations and were able to reach reasonable equilibration. Trajectories from the simulations were postanalyzed (imaged on one of the protein components and converted to the pdb format) using MDTraj v1.9.4 (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) and visualized using the software package PyMOL v2.2.0.

          <title>MST Assay</title>
          <p>MST assay was done by Reaction Biology Corp. Briefly, protein CDK6 was labeled using the Protein Labeling Kit RED-NHS (NanoTemper Technologies). The labeling reaction was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions in the supplied labeling buffer applying a concentration of 15 μmol/L protein (molar dye/protein ratio ≈3:1) at room temperature for 30 minutes. Unreacted dye was removed with the supplied dye removal column equilibrated with storage buffer [50 mmol/L Hepes, pH 7.5; 500 mmol/L NaCl; 10% glycerol; 0.25 mmol/L Tris (2-carboxy-ethyl)-phosphin-HCl; and 0.01% Tween 20]. The degree of labeling was determined using UV-visible spectrophotometry at 650 and 280 nm. A degree of labeling of 0.6 was achieved. The labeled protein CDK6 was adjusted to 12 nmol/L with assay buffer (20 mmol/L K phosphate, pH 8.0; 50 mmol/L NaCl; and 0.05% Pluronic). Then, 250 nmol/L p18 was preincubated with CDK6 for 15 minutes prior to the addition of ligand. The ligand abemaciclib was dissolved in assay buffer, and a series of sixteen 1:1 dilutions was prepared using the same buffer, producing ligand concentrations ranging from 122 pmol/L to 4 μmol/L. Each ligand dilution was mixed with one volume of labeled protein, resulting in a final labeled CDK6 concentration of 6 nmol/L and final ligand concentrations ranging from 61 pmol/L to 2 nmol/L. After a 20-minute incubation, the samples were loaded into standard Monolith NT.115 Capillaries (NanoTemper Technologies). MST was measured using a Monolith NT.115 instrument (NanoTemper Technologies) at an ambient temperature of 25°C. Instrument parameters were adjusted to 10% LED power and medium MST power. Data of three independently pipetted measurements were analyzed (MO.Affinity Analysis software version 2.1.3; NanoTemper Technologies) using the signal from an MST-on time of 5 seconds. The data were expressed as baseline-corrected normalized fluorescence, ΔFnorm [‰]. To obtain ΔFnorm, the baseline Fnorm value is subtracted from all data points of the same curve. (The baseline Fnorm value is equivalent to the mean Fnorm value of the unbound target, usually in capillaries 14–16, and is given by the MO.Affinity Analysis software as the “unbound” value when a fit is performed.)</p>

These cell lines largely overlap with and reflect the diversity of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) cell lines (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new">https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle</ext-link>). Cell lines were grown in RPMI 10% FBS without phenol red for adherent lines and RPMI 20% FBS without phenol red for suspension lines. Parental cell lines were stably infected with a unique 24-nucleotide DNA barcode via lentiviral transduction and blasticidin selection. After selection, barcoded cell lines were expanded and QCed (<italic toggle="yes">Mycoplasma</italic> contamination test, an SNP test for confirming cell line identity, and barcode ID confirmation).
