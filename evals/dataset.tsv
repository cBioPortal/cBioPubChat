What are the most commonly mutated genes in breast cancer?	TP53, PIK3CA, GATA3, CDH1, ESR1
Are silent clonal hematopoietic genotypes relevant for patients with nonhematologic cancers?	According to the Cancer Therapy and Clonal Hematopoiesis study, silent clonal hematopoietic genotypes can reveal underlying risks for hematologic malignancies and may influence the management and monitoring strategies for patients with nonhematologic cancers.
How does the genomic landscape differ between primary and metastatic tumors according to the MSK MetTropism study?	The study found that metastatic tumors often harbor additional mutations not present in primary tumors, indicating genomic evolution during metastasis. This highlights the importance of sequencing metastatic lesions for comprehensive genomic profiling.
What are the key genomic differences between lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas identified in the Pan-Lung Cancer TCGA study?	The study identified distinct mutational profiles for each subtype, with adenocarcinomas frequently exhibiting EGFR mutations, while squamous cell carcinomas showed alterations in genes like TP53 and CDKN2A, underscoring the need for subtype-specific therapeutic approaches.
Which KRAS mutations are most common in colorectal cancer?	G12D, G12V, G12C, G12A, G12S, G13D
What therapeutic strategies are suggested by the dominant molecular alterations and immune landscape features characteristic of upper tract urothelial carcinoma?	The presence of activated FGFR3 signaling and a T-cell depleted microenvironment suggests that FGFR3 inhibitors and strategies to modulate the immune contexture could be effective therapeutic approaches.
What is the average number of driver mutations found per cancer genome in PCAWG study?	The PCAWG study found that, on average, each cancer genome harbored 4 to 5 driver mutations when considering both coding and non-coding genomic elements.
Are there molecular subtypes of meningioma that correlate with clinical behavior or prognosis?	es, meningiomas can be classified into molecular subtypes, including NF2-mutated, TRAF7/KLF4-mutated, SMARCB1-mutated, and POLR2A-mutated groups, each associated with distinct clinical behaviors and prognoses.
What molecular subgroups are identified in early-onset prostate cancer?	Early-onset prostate cancer can be classified into four molecular subgroups: one defined by SPOP and FOXA1 mutations without ETS gene fusions; another characterized by TMPRSS2â€“ERG fusions with high androgen receptor signaling; a third marked by high ESRP1 expression driven by 8q duplication and associated with aggressive behavior; and a heterogeneous group lacking these defining features. These subtypes reflect distinct biological pathways and clinical profiles.
What genetic alterations drive CDK6-mediated resistance in metastatic breast cancer patients?	The Metastatic Breast Cancer (MSK, Cancer Discovery 2022) study found that genetic alterations such as FAT1 loss, PTEN loss, and ARID1A loss were found to promote CDK6 upregulation and concomitant INK4 protein induction, leading to CDK4/6i resistance. These alterations were present in 17% of metastatic breast cancer patients analyzed.
What genomic alterations are enriched in metastatic breast tumors after hormonal therapy?	The Breast Cancer (MSK, Cancer Cell 2018) study found that mutations in the MAPK pathway (e.g., ERBB2 activating mutations, NF1 loss-of-function, EGFR amplifications) and alterations in key transcriptional regulators (MYC, CTCF, FOXA1, and TBX3) were significantly more common in specimens acquired after endocrine therapy. These alterations were largely mutually exclusive with ESR1 mutations and collectively affected 22% of all post-hormonal therapy tumors.
How are Luminal B breast tumor subtypes determined in the TCGA dataset?	The PAM50-defined subtype predictor was used to classify breast tumors into intrinsic subtypes, including Luminal B.
Are there studies that include whole-genome sequencing of both tumor and matched normal samples?	Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes (ICGC/TCGA, Nature 2020)
Are there studies containing promoter methylation data?	Breast Cancer (METABRIC, Nature 2012 & Nat Commun 2016)
Are there studies with information about lipid levels in tumors?	Glioblastoma (CPTAC, Cell 2021)
Which studies provide information on non-coding driver mutations?	Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes (ICGC/TCGA, Nature 2020)
Are there studies with information about cisplatin treatment in bladder cancer?	Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma (DFCI/MSK, Cancer Discov 2014)
